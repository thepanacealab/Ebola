1-Aug-18,no result found,no result found,Looks like Ebola may be back in DRC This tweet is from the Governor of Nord Kivu the province in NE DRC where c httpstcoY3PgudkYFM,"Today the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) said four people in the eastern part of the country tested positive for Ebola virus, 1 week after the country declared an 11-week outbreak in the western region over.

The DRC said there was no evidence to suggest the new outbreak was connected to the previous event, which resulted in 54 confirmed illnesses, 33 of them fatal.

Mobile lab team dispatched to outbreak site

Oly Ilunga, MD, of the DRC's health ministry, took to Twitter today to announce the cases, which are centered around Beni in the Magina health district. He said a mobile team of 12 will be arriving in Beni tomorrow to set up a laboratory.

""We knew a #10 Ebola outbreak was inevitable because of the presence of the virus in the Equitoreal Forest but we did not know it woudl happen so quickly,"" a tweet from Ilunga said. The original tweet was in French.

""Ebola is a constant threat in the DRC,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, World Health Organization (WHO) director-general, in a statement sent to media. ""What adds to our confidence in the country's ability to respond is the transparency they have displayed once again. Working closely with the Ministry of Health and partners, we will fight this one as we did the last.""

At least 20 dead reported in conflict zone

According to a statement from the ministry of health, of 26 people with hemorrhagic illness signs, 20 people have died in an area 100 kilometers from the border with Uganda. The province, known as North Kivu, is a conflict zone and is home to 1 million displaced people.

""This new cluster is occurring in an environment which is very different from where we were operating in the northwest,"" said Peter Salama, MD, WHO deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response. ""This is an active conflict zone. The major barrier will be safely accessing the affected population.""

According to an African media report on Monday, the outbreak began in early July, and symptoms included fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and nose bleeds. The DRC said 26 people have reported illnesses.

Twenty people have already died from hemorrhagic fevers in and around Mangina, a densely populated town about 30 km (18 miles) southwest of the city of Beni and 100 km from the Ugandan border, the ministry said in its statement, without saying when the deaths occurred.

A team of 12 experts from Congo’s health ministry will arrive in Beni on Thursday to set up a mobile lab, the ministry said. The World Health Organization has started moving staff and supplies to the area, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

They head to a region where deep security problems could complicate efforts to contain the virus. About 1,000 civilians have been killed by armed groups and government soldiers around Beni since 2014, and the wider region of North Kivu holds over 1 million displaced people.

“This is an active conflict zone. The major barrier will be safely accessing the affected population,” Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General of emergency preparedness and response, said in a statement.

Jeremy Konyndyk, an aid expert at the Center for Global Development, said other recent Ebola outbreaks had fortunately been in relatively safe and stable areas.

“North Kivu is a different story, which makes me a little nervous,” he said.

The area also has strong trade with neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, raising the risk of the virus moving internationally.

Julie Hall, chief of staff at the International Federation of the Red Cross, said the Ebola response in North Kivu would be a “highly complex” operation.

The ministry said no evidence linked this outbreak with the last one, which began in April and occurred over 2,500 km (1,553 miles) away in northwestern Congo.

BATS AND BODY FLUIDS

This is the central African country’s 10th outbreak since 1976, when the virus was discovered near the eponymous Ebola river in the north. That is more than twice as many as any other country.

Ebola is believed to be spread over long distances by bats and can turn up in bush meat sold at food markets throughout Congo. Once present in humans, it causes hemorrhagic fever, vomiting and diarrhea and is spread through direct contact with body fluids.

An outbreak concentrated in the West African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea killed at least 11,300 people between 2013 and 2016.

Congolese and international health officials were credited with responding rapidly to the last outbreak, including by deploying an experimental vaccine manufactured by Merck, one of several vaccines being developed against Ebola.

But the Merck vaccine is designed to be used against the Zaire strain of Ebola, and there has been no confirmation of the strain in the latest outbreak, with the WHO calling it only “presumptive Ebola”.

A WHO spokesman declined to comment on possible vaccine use.

Aside from the vaccine, the key factors in halting the previous outbreak appeared to be aggressive tracing of potential patients and the speed of the response.

The WHO said the fact that it already had staff and equipment in place would give it a head start against the new outbreak.

“Ebola is a constant threat in DRC. What adds to our confidence in the country’s ability to respond is the transparency they have displayed once again,” WHO head Tedros said.

“We will fight this one as we did the last.”","A team from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies conducted a training on safe burials during Ebola outbreaks in June in Itipo, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

A week after the most recent Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was declared over, the country has confirmed it has found more cases of the disease.

The new cases are in a province at the opposite end of the country from the earlier outbreak, making it unclear if this is a new epidemic or a continuation of the previous one. But a statement from the ministry of health on Wednesday said the distance of more than 1,500 miles suggests these cases are not linked to the outbreak in Bikoro.

“It’s unlikely to be connected to the previous outbreak,” Jessica Ilunga, a spokeswoman for Health Minister Oly Ilunga, told STAT.

Samples from four sick people have tested positive for Ebola. But it is still not clear which species of the virus is responsible. There are six known species of ebolaviruses; most outbreaks in DRC have been caused by the Ebola Zaire virus.

The new cases have occurred in North Kivu province, which is located in northeastern DRC, along the border with Uganda and Rwanda. Last weekend the country’s health ministry reported that there had been 26 people sick with fever and “hemorrhagic signs” at a place called Mangina. Of those, 20 had died.

Six samples were sent to the national laboratory in Kinshasa on Tuesday. Testing is still underway to determine the species responsible, Ilunga said.

A team of 12 experts from Kinshasa will arrive in the outbreak area on Thursday to set up the needed components of the response, the health ministry’s statement said. The team will include laboratory technicians, epidemiologists, clinical psychologists, and doctors, and will be equipped with a mobile laboratory and personal protective equipment.

During the Bikoro outbreak, there was grave concern the town’s proximity to the Congo River could allow for spread of the virus to several major cities along the busy waterway, including the DRC capital, Kinshasa.

The geography of this outbreak is different, but also challenging. The region has long been riven with political conflict. North Kivu province is also home to more than 1 million displaced people. And there is significant cross-border travel with Rwanda and Uganda.

“This new cluster is occurring in an environment which is very different from where we were operating in the northwest,” Dr Peter Salama, deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response at the World Health Organization, said in a statement. “This is an active conflict zone. The major barrier will be safely accessing the affected population.”

The health ministry’s statement noted that experimental Ebola therapies, sent to DRC during the Bikoro outbreak, are still in the country.

“The ethics and scientific committees will determine the most appropriate curative and preventive treatments for this tenth epidemic,” it said.

But determining the species of the virus responsible for the new outbreak will be critical. The experimental vaccine used during the Bikoro outbreak targets Ebola Zaire, as does the ZMapp monoclonal antibody treatment.

If the new cases are caused by a different ebolavirus species, prevention and treatment options will be more limited."

The Zaire species was also the cause of the recent outbreak 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) away, in Mbandaka, DRC. Officials declared that outbreak over 1 week ago. A total of 54 cases of Ebola were confirmed in the earlier outbreak, including 33 fatalities.

So far four people have been confirmed as having Ebola in the latest outbreak, with as many as 20 more suspected illnesses near the village of Mangina, which is about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the city of Beni. The area is near the Uganda border, and home to nearly 1 million displaced people.

Survey finds gaps, regional differences in school district crisis plans

A review of how well school districts are prepared to manage disasters, including pandemic influenza, found gaps in achieving goals set by the federal Healthy People 2020 plan, scientists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).

The researchers looked data from 2006, 2012, and 2016 from the School Health Policies and Practices Study, a national survey periodically conducted by the CDC to assess school health policies. Across the three intervals, the number of school districts samples ranged from 461 to 697, with response rates from 64% to 66.5%.

The investigators found that district requirements for crisis plans varied by urbanicity. In 2016, large districts were significantly more likely than small districts to provide funding or offer crisis training preparedness for faculty, staff, and students' families. The number of districts requiring schools to include family reunification procedures in their plans rose in suburban areas from 2006 to 2016, but the percentage of districts that requires schools to include pandemic influenza or other disease outbreaks in their plans decreased in rural areas and in the South.

For crisis training funding for faculty and staff, researchers saw regional differences, with districts in the South less likely to allocate support for the efforts compared with schools in the Midwest. And schools in the Midwest were less likely to offer crisis training for students' families than their counterparts in the Northeast, South, and West.

Though most districts have plans to address mental health needs and family reunification after an emergency, one in four fall short, and one in three don't have policies in place to prepare for infectious disease outbreaks, according to the repot. ""Because schools often function as community hubs, these gaps in preparedness planning leave communities potentially vulnerable to critical public health threats,"" the authors wrote.

They concluded that the report's findings highlight the need for wider adoption of policies on family reunification, pandemic influenza and other infectious diseases, and provisions for students and staff with special needs, especially in rural areas.

Study details locally acquired rat lungworm infections in US patients

Health providers, especially in the southern United States, should consider angiostrongyliasis, a brain infection caused by larvae from the rat lungworm (Angiostrongylus cantonensis) parasite, in patients with eosinophilic meningitis, especially those have a history of eating snails or slugs or fresh produce contaminated with their larvae, according to a separate MMWR report today.

A team from the CDC and its partners in Alabama, California, Colorado, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah described 12 angiostrongyliasis cases that occurred in the continental United States from January 2011 through January 2017.

Six of the cases were likely contracted in the United States, and six of the patients had eaten raw vegetables, three from local gardens. Two had consumed raw snails, and two others had potential environmental exposure to snails. One had eaten slugs, and one had possible exposure to slugs. Some of the patients had eaten shrimp or crab, mainly cooked.

Eleven of the patients received systemic steroids, as recommended, and seven got an antiparasitic drug. All but one of the patients was alive 11 months after the initial exam. Symptoms improved for all 11, but 4 had lingering neurologic symptoms.

Longhorned tick found in 7th state: Pennsylvania

The invasive longhorned tick has now been found in seven US states, after the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) reported the tick on a wild deer in Centre County this week.

Tests by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, have confirmed the presence of Haemaphysalis longicornis, the PDA said in a news release. The tick, originally from Asia, is known to carry several diseases in hogs and cattle in indigenous regions, but so far ticks examined in the United States don't carry any infectious pathogens, the PDA said. The longhorned tick can also transmit human disease but has not been associated with any in this country.

""Even experts have difficulty distinguishing among tick species, so it is important to take precautions to protect pets, livestock and family members from becoming a host for ticks of any kind,"" Pennsylvania State Veterinarian David Wolfgang, DVM, said in the release. ""Scientists don't yet know how this species will adapt to the North American climate and animal hosts, but we know it survived New Jersey's winter and has infested sheep and cattle in this region.""

The tick can reproduce without male fertilization—essentially clone itself—and a single blood-fed female tick can create an entire localized population. After initially being identified in New Jersey last September, it has since been confirmed in Arkansas, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and New York state.

Short-term treatment yields better outcomes for latent TB, study says

A study today in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that a 4-month course of rifampin is more effective in treating latent tuberculosis (TB) than the standard 9-month treatment with isoniazid (INH), because patients are more likely to adhere to the treatment.

Latent TB does not cause symptoms but can be dormant inside a person for years before causing serious health problems. The study followed more than 6,800 adults and 850 children diagnosed as having latent TB.

More than 85% of children who received rifampin completed treatment without developing an active TB infection, compared with 76% of children treated with INH. The difference in completion rates between the rifampin and INH groups in adults was 15.1 percentage points.

According to the study, among the 3,443 adult patients in the rifampin group, active TB developed in 4 patients and clinically diagnosed active TB developed in 4 during 7,732 person-years of follow-up, as compared with 4 and 5 patients, respectively, among 3,416 patients in the INH group during 7,652 person-years of follow-up.

Rates of adverse events were similar in treatment groups, seen in fewer than 5% of participants.

""The four month treatment was as effective in preventing TB, safer and more acceptable,"" said study leader Dick Menzies, MD, in a McGill University press release. ""We believe this four month rifampin treatment should replace the nine months on INH for most people who need therapy for latent TB."" Menzies is a researcher at the McGill International TB Centre.

Trump names meteorologist as science adviser

President Donald Trump named Kelvin Droegemeier, PhD, to be director of the federal Office of Science and Technology Policy. Trump had delayed naming a science adviser since his inauguration in January of 2017.

According to the White House, Droegemeier currently serves as the vice president for research and the regent's professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma. He previously served two terms on the National Science Board under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He is a fellow of the American Meteorological Society and American Association for the Advancement of Science.

According to The New York Times, Droegemeier is well-respected among fellow meteorologists and scientists, and has conducted pivotal research on short-term storm systems.

His views on climate change, however, are not well known. Scientists have routinely criticized the Trump administration as being anti-science and have objected to the president's withdrawal of the United States from the Paris climate agreement.

Jul 31 White House statement

Aug 1 New York Times article","The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has announced a new outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, just days after a recent emergence of the disease, which killed 33 people, was declared over.

Four cases of the virus were confirmed in northeastern North Kivu province, the DRC's health minister said in a statement on Wednesday, though there was no indication they were linked to the country's previous - and ninth - Ebola outbreak in northwestern Equateur Province.

""Although we did not expect to face a tenth epidemic so early, the detection of the virus is an indicator of the proper functioning of the surveillance system,"" Health Minister Oly Ilunga said.

However, it might be impossible to use a vaccine to tackle the new outbreak, Peter Salama, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official, said.

Officials have not confirmed the particular strain of Ebola causing the outbreak but Salama said it could be the Zaire, Sudan or Bundibugyo strain.

If it is the Zaire strain, the Merck vaccine used in the last outbreak may be an option, otherwise the situation will be much more complex ""and we may not have any vaccine options"", he told Reuters at WHO's headquarters in Geneva.

International experts on Thursday set up a laboratory in the city of Beni, 30km from where the outbreak was declared.

Ebola is a virus-caused hemorrhagic fever that in extreme cases causes fatal bleeding from internal organs, the mouth, eyes or ears.





Four confirmed cases

{articleGUID}

North Kivu authorities alerted the health ministry on Saturday that 26 cases of hemorrhagic fever, including 20 deaths, had occurred in and around Mangina, a town about 30km west of the city of Beni and 100km from the DRC's border with Uganda.

Six samples were taken from hospitalised patients and sent to the National Institute of Biological Research in Kinshasa, the capital, for analysis. Four of the samples tested positive for the Ebola virus.

A team of 12 experts from the health ministry will arrive in Beni on Thursday to set up a response operation, the ministry said, and local travel restrictions were being implemented.

'A constant threat'

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said in a tweet on Wednesday that health officials would continue to fight the ""constant threat"" of Ebola in the DRC.

The latest outbreak comes after DRC authorities declared a previous emergence of the disease - which has no proven cure - over on July 24.

{articleGUID}

The declaration brought the curtain down on an outbreak which began two months earlier in the remote northwestern area of Bikoro, about 2,000km from Mangina, on May 8 and culminated in 54 confirmed cases of Ebola, 33 of which proved fatal.

Health officials said a quick international response and the vaccination of more than 3,300 people were decisive factors in containing the virus.

The outbreak took place fewer than 12 months on from the DRC's previous Ebola scare, in May 2017, during which eight people were infected, four of whom died.

The average fatality rate among those infected with Ebola is about 50 percent, according to the WHO.

A team of experts is expected to arrive in the area today to set up the necessary response.

Scientists discover a new cell that could be linked to cystic fibrosis Scientists have discovered a new type of cell that lines the airway and looks a bit like a cell found in the gills of fish and skin of frogs. In a pair of papers published in Nature, two independent research teams report that the new cell, called a pulmonary ioncyte, was found in the windpipe and seems to play a part in cystic fibrosis. The disease causes mucus to build up in the lungs, clogging airways and trapping bacteria that can cause infections. The finding could shift the basic biological understanding of CF and point to potential new drug targets. STAT’s Andrew Joseph talked to outside scientists who cheered the research, but also said it raised questions about whether the cell would have the same kind of involvement at the end of the airway, where CF first emerges.

Quetiapine is often used off label in patients with dementia, but has been tied to potentially harmful side effects among elderly patients. Public health researchers ran a randomized trial with more than 5,000 primary care doctors with high quetiapine prescribing rates. Some received a letter that flagged that their rates were higher than their peers and warned that abusive prescribing can lead to audits or a loss of Medicare billing privileges. Over two years, prescribing rates fell much more among doctors who received the letter. The authors say that suggests the letters might serve as a way to push physicians to take another look at their prescribing habits. Could nanoparticles bust biofilms to prevent cavities?

While only four Ebola cases have been confirmed, Salama said there are 20 deaths near the town of Mangina that were possibly caused by the virus. So far 10 locations near Mangina have been identified as having possible cases.

""It's extremely likely that the it's Ebola-Zaire,"" said Salama, echoing the DRC's ministry of health's assessment of the species causing the illnesses. Salama said a full genetic analysis of samples will be available next Tuesday.

What is known is that on Jul 28 in North Kivu province, a suspicious cluster of cases and deaths alerted DRC officials, who began to collect samples. The inciting incident, Salama said, was a woman who visited a local hospital for an illness in late July.

""As she was leaving the hospital after being treated for another ailment, she started getting a fever and other symptoms of Ebola,"" Salama said. The woman died, and seven of her relatives developed similar symptoms. Salama also said a healthcare worker has died in this outbreak, but it's unknown if that person treated the woman.

Different outbreak, different challenges

While it cannot be ruled out, Salama said there's no evidence to suggest this outbreak is related to the one that ended on Jul 24. That outbreak took 33 lives on the western side of DRC.

The Equatorial rainforest, which reaches across DRC, provides a reservoir for the Ebola virus. Most often, the virus jumps from animals to humans through fruit bats, or the consumption of raw or partially cooked bush meats. The Zaire species of the virus is the most deadly to humans, with a case-fatality rate usually near 50%.

Salama said the current outbreak will be an extremely challenging one for the WHO and the DRC to fight because of location. Rebel fighters populate the region, which is home to 1 million displaced people. Unlike the outbreak this spring, health workers will not be able to cross rural expanses on motorcycles or easily reach communities because of safety issues.

""This is a war zone, and the one very serious complex factor is security,"" Salama said. ""Access will be the biggest challenge.""

If genetic analysis proves definitively that the virus is the Zaire species, Merck's unlicensed vaccine is expected to be used in a ring vaccination, as it was in the previous DRC outbreak, which was just declared over. According to Salama, there are 3,000 doses of VSV-EBOV vaccine immediately available, and 300,000 more doses can be mobilized in short notice.

The DRC also published an update yesterday, confirming that the minister of health, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, visited Beni and Mangina. A mobile lab is being set up in Beni.

In the world of Ebola outbreaks, lucky breaks are few and far between. But it appears the Democratic Republic of the Congo may have caught a small one in its latest go-round with the dangerous disease.

And it might also give the world another shot at testing an experimental Ebola vaccine.

Officials in the DRC said Thursday that testing has shown that the virus causing disease in North Kivu province in the northeast of the country is Ebola Zaire. That is the virus targeted by Merck’s experimental vaccine, which was tested during the West African outbreak in 2014 and 2015, and used in eastern DRC in an outbreak earlier this year.

There had been concerns that, given the location of the outbreak, another species of Ebola might have been causing the illnesses. That would have meant few possibilities for experimental drugs and potentially no vaccines options.

Despite the potential of a vaccine to help in this outbreak, delivering it could prove challenging, warned Dr. Peter Salama, the head of the World Health’s Organization’s emergency response program.

Battling factions operate in the area, and there are roughly 1 million displaced people the province. The danger inherent in operating in this part of DRC means a modified approach to the vaccination rollout may be needed, Salama said.

In the outbreak earlier this year in DRC, health officials used a ring vaccination program, in which they tracked down the contacts of cases and the contacts of those contacts, and offered them all vaccine in a bid to halt spread. That approach might not be viable in North Kivu.

“The ring vaccination strategy is highly dependent on access, and really strong access to the population that’s being targeted,” Salama told STAT. “The ring vaccination is really the big question mark [here].”

Salama said consideration is being given to an “out-in strategy,” which would create a ring around an area where there had been cases, rather than trying to find and vaccinate specific individuals. The idea would be to start “with a protective buffer around a whole geographical zone,” and then moving inward, offering vaccine to everyone in the area.

A lot will depend on how freely the vaccine teams can travel. And that will be determined in negotiations with the United Nations peacekeeping operation in the region.

“We’re discussing with the U.N. what the security ceiling will be for the number of staff that they’ll allow us to deploy,” Salama said. “And also, what sort of armed vehicles, armed escorts, or otherwise that we’ll need to use. And that’s going to make it much more difficult.”

If officials are able to deliver the vaccine, there is reason to hope that people in the area will be willing to use it. During the earlier outbreak, in Bikoro, nearly 3,500 people were vaccinated and vaccine acceptance was extraordinarily high. Over 98 percent of people offered the vaccine agreed to be vaccinated.

The fact that the Ebola Zaire virus is the cause of the outbreak also opens up the most options for experimental drugs to treat patients. In addition to the Merck vaccines, supplies of five potential therapeutics are already in the country, having been sent during the Bikoro outbreak.

None of the drugs was used during the previous outbreak. By the time DRC’s scientific and ethical committees reviewed the available scientific data and authorized the drugs for compassionate use, there were no more Ebola patients in care.

But that review process should speed usage of the drugs this time, Salama said. He said the drugs will be used on a compassionate basis.

Three of the experimental therapeutics are monoclonal antibodies — immune system combatants that can recognize and combat Ebola. They are: ZMapp, produced by Mapp Biopharmaceutical; REGN3470-3471-3479, made by Regeneron; and an early stage therapeutic called mAb 114, which is a joint project of the DRC’s National Institute of Biomedical Research and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

On 1 August 2018, the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa reported that four of six samples collected from hospitalised patients tested positive by GeneXpert automated PCR. These presumptive positive tests prompted an immediate escalation of response activities by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, and the declaration of the outbreak by the Minister of Health.

The prompt alert by the Ministry of Health to WHO, under the International Health Regulations, followed the detection and rapid investigation of a cluster of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in a family in North Kivu Province during mid to late July 2018. Local health officials have since identified sporadic, antecedent deaths in the community since May 2018 (tentatively classified as probable cases), which are subject to ongoing investigations to determine if they are related to the current outbreak.

The Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners are working to establish the full extent of this outbreak. As of 3 August 2018, a total of 43 Ebola virus disease cases (13 confirmed and 30 probable), including 33 deaths, have been reported. An additional 33 suspected cases are currently pending laboratory testing to confirm or exclude Ebola virus disease. Three healthcare workers have been affected, of whom one has died.

Geographically, confirmed and probable cases are currently localised to five health zones in North Kivu Province (38 cases, including 13 confirmed and 25 probable), and one health zone in Ituri Province (5 probable cases) (Figure 1). Suspected cases are currently under investigation in one additional health zone of Ituri Province. The affected areas host over one million displaced people and shares borders with Rwanda and Uganda, with frequent cross border movement due to trade activities. The prolonged humanitarian crisis and deterioration of the security situation is expected to hinder response to this outbreak.

Further laboratory testing by INRB has detected Ebolavirus using conventional PCR in three of the initial batch of six samples from Mabalako Health Zone. These results are highly suggestive that Ebola Zaire species is the cause of this outbreak; however, genetic sequencing is necessary to definitively confirm the virus species.

Characterization of viral sequences will help to inform the potential use of vaccines and therapeutics, and any link to the recent outbreak in Équateur Province – located in the far west of the country, some 2 500 km from the current outbreak. Currently there is no evidence to suggest that these events are related.

Public health response

The Ministry of Health has initiated response mechanisms in North Kivu and Ituri provinces with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include the establishment and strengthening of surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management, community engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination, cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. In addition, the potential for use of Ebola vaccines, as well as therapeutics for treatment of Ebola virus disease, are being reviewed.

The Ministry of Health and WHO have deployed Rapid Response Teams to the affected health zones to initiate response activities.

WHO has activated country, regional and global coordination mechanisms to assess risks and respond accordingly to the event. An incident management team has been established in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and support teams have been reactivated at the WHO Regional Office for Africa and at headquarters. Coordination meetings with Ministry of Health and partners were held on 1 August 2018 for deployment of human resources and material. Immediate logistical capabilities and needs are being established, and a full response plan is being developed.

WHO has provided technical and operations support to the Ministry of Health and partners in the activation of a multi-partner multi-agency Emergency Operations Centre to coordinate the response.

With support of international partners, Ebola treatment centres are being established in Mangina, Beni and Goma.

A mobile laboratory has been established in Beni to facilitate timely diagnoses of suspected cases. The establishment of additional laboratory capacities elsewhere is being explored.

Contact tracing activities have been initiated. Thus far, 879 contacts have been registered for follow-up.

The Regional Emergency Director for Africa has informed neighbouring countries (Rwanda and Uganda) of the outbreak and emphasized the importance of surveillance and preparedness actions, especially along the border.

Activities to sensitize communities to the outbreak, and hygiene and sanitation measures, through media and churches have begun in affected communities, and in neighbouring Uganda and Rwanda.

On 1 August, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) Operational Support Team has issued an alert to its network partners, providing an overview of the current situation and ongoing response activities. On 2 August, the GOARN Steering Committee and WHO Regional Office for Africa conducted a joint coordination call for operational partners in Africa. GOARN partners continue to contribute to response activities.

WHO risk assessment

This new outbreak of Ebola virus disease is affecting north eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which border Uganda. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing several epidemics and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu may hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public health risk is considered high at the national and regional levels and low globally.

WHO advice

As investigations continue to establish the full extent of this outbreak, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries to ensure health authorities are alerted and prepared to respond.

WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event.

DAKAR (Reuters) - An outbreak of the Ebola virus declared this week in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo is believed to have killed 33 people, the health ministry said on Saturday.

Thirteen cases of the hemorrhagic fever have been confirmed, including three deaths, the ministry said in a statement, adding that suspected cases had been detected in both North Kivu and neighboring Ituri province.

Three cases have been confirmed in Beni, a regional trading hub of several hundred thousand people about 30 km (18 miles) from the center of the outbreak in the town of Mabalako, and some 70 km from the Ugandan border.

The latest flare-up was announced one week after Congo’s government declared the end of another outbreak in northwestern Congo that is believed to have killed 33 people as well. Health authorities say they have no evidence the two are connected.

So far, 879 people who came into contact with Ebola patients have been identified, the ministry said. Tracking those contacts, however, could be difficult in this part of the country, given its dense population and the presence of dozens of militia groups.

As with the outbreak in western Congo, health officials plan to deploy a vaccine manufactured by Merck that they have credited with helping disrupt the spread of the virus after it reached a river port city with transport links to the capital Kinshasa.

A so-called cold chain, the series of measures needed to keep the vaccine well below zero in a tropical climate without reliable power supplies, will be set up in Beni this weekend, the statement said.",no result found

Thirteen cases of the virus were confirmed across northeastern North Kivu province and neighbouring Ituri province, DRC's health minister said in a statement on Saturday, with another 30 ""probable"" cases registered.

Three people were confirmed killed by the virus and 30 suspected Ebola deaths are being investigated since the outbreak was declared on Wednesday.

Laboratory examinations aimed at determining whether the ""probable"" cases tested positive for Ebola, which has no proven cure, were ongoing.

'Active conflict zone'

Almost 900 ""contacts"" - meaning people who may have come into contact with an infected person - have been registered by the health ministry.

Vaccinations were being deployed to the city of Beni, in North Kivu province, the statement said.

However, an ""active conflict"" in the area could prove to be a ""major barrier"" to health workers safely accessing the affected population, Peter Salama, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official, warned last week.

WHO released $2m from its contingency fund for emergencies to help fund DRC's response to the newest outbreak.

North Kivu, which borders Uganda and Rwanda, is a resource-rich province in which more than 100 armed groups operate, according to Human Rights Watch. More than one million people are displaced there.

The security situation in the province made any response planning ""complex"", WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told Al Jazeera on Sunday.

""Even though we have access to the towns of Mangina and Beni, we don't know to what extent we're going to have to rely on armed escorts for broader contact tracing outside those small towns,"" Jasarevic said.

""That's going to be a critical determining factor in our ability to respond.""

'Unsecured burial'

Authorities were alerted to the DRC's most recent Ebola outbreak - its tenth since 1976 - by the death of a 65-year-old woman in Mangina, a town about 30km west of Beni, last month.

After her ""unsecured burial"", relatives of the woman also displayed symptoms of the virus, seven of whom died.

Ebola is a virus-caused hemorrhagic fever that in extreme cases causes fatal bleeding from internal organs, the mouth, eyes or ears. The average fatality rate among those infected is about 50 percent, according to WHO.

The latest outbreak comes after DRC officials declared an Ebola crisis in northwestern Equateur province over on July 24. That outbreak in May killed 33 people with 54 confirmed cases.



Health officials said a quick international response and the vaccination of more than 3,300 people were decisive factors in containing the virus.

The worst Ebola epidemic occurred between 2013 and 2016 when it killed about 11,300 people in West Africa as it surged through Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.

Ebola is passed from human-to-human by contact through the mouth, nose, or broken skin with blood or other bodily fluids by those infected.

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Vaccinations against a new outbreak of Ebola virus in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo are due to begin on Wednesday, a senior official at the health ministry said on Sunday.

The experimental vaccine, which is manufactured by Merck, proved successful during its first wide-scale usage against an outbreak in northwestern Congo that was declared over less than two weeks ago.

More than 3,000 doses remain in stock in the capital Kinshasa, allowing authorities to quickly deploy it to the affected areas near the Ugandan border.

As with the previous outbreak, vaccination will focus on health workers and people who have come into contact with confirmed cases of the disease, said Barthe Ndjoloko, who oversees the health ministry’s Ebola response.

“Teams are conducting investigations on the ground to identify the contacts of the confirmed cases, including health workers,” he told reporters in the town of Beni.

Health workers are in the process of setting up a so-called cold chain, the series of measures needed to keep the vaccine well below zero in a tropical climate without reliable power supplies, the ministry said.",no result found
6-Aug-18,no result found,Ebola Situation on Monday 6 August 2018 A total of 43 cases including 16 confirmed and 27 probable 31 cases suspe httpstcoVhIY9KbKTo,no result found,"Over the weekend, the number of confirmed Ebola cases in the new Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak in North Kivu province in the east of the country jumped from 4 to 13, and health officials said investigations are under way to see if sporadic illnesses and deaths in the area since May might be part of the outbreak.

The number of confirmed and probable cases hit 43, across six health zones, and include 33 deaths.

In other developments, the DRC's health ministry provided more details about the status of the response and the early cases, and an African media source said territorial officials are investigating a suspected Ebola case in yet another province—Haute Uele.

Tests on 33 more possible cases

The World Health Organization (WHO) said in an Aug 4 update that, as of Aug 3, 43 cases have been reported, including the 13 lab-confirmed illnesses and 30 probable cases. Also, tests are pending on 33 additional suspected cases. So far, 33 deaths have been reported.

Three healthcare workers have been sickened in the outbreak, one of them fatally, the WHO said. Infections in health workers is a concern in Ebola outbreaks, not only because the workers play a key role in battling the virus, but also because such infections can amplify the spread of the disease.

The confirmed and probable cases are in five health zones in North Kivu province and one health zone in Ituri province. Suspected cases have been reported in one more Ituri province health zone.

A mobile lab is already operating in Beni, and responders are exploring the possibility of setting up more testing locations, the WHO said.

Contact tracing is already under way, and so far 879 people have been registered for follow-up.

Earlier conventional lab tests highly suggest that the Ebola Zaire species is the cause of the latest outbreak, but the WHO said genetic sequencing is needed to confirm the finding. Ebola Zaire is the species most deadly to humans. Genetic characterization will help guide the use of vaccines and drugs; VSV-EBOV, the candidate vaccine furthest along in clinical trials, targets the Ebola Zaire species and could be used if the new outbreak strain matches the vaccine strain.

Ebola Zaire caused both the earlier DRC outbreak that was declared over on Jul 24 and the devastating 2014-16 outbreak in West Africa.

Genetic tests would also reveal any possible link between the new outbreak and the recent one declared over in the west of the country; however, the WHO said the two sites are located about 1,550 miles apart, and there's no evidence yet that suggests the outbreaks are related.

Community education and measures to address hygiene and sanitation issues have started through media and churches in affected communities, as well as in the neighboring countries of Uganda and Rwanda.

High risk of national, regional spread

Affected areas are home to more than 1 million displaced people, the WHO said. ""The prolonged humanitarian crisis and deterioration of the security situation is expected to hinder response to this outbreak,"" the WHO said.

Given the complexities of the security situation in conflict-ridden North Kivu province, combined with internal population displacement, other disease outbreaks, and the area's long-term humanitarian crisis, the risk to the DRC and the region is considered high, the WHO said. The global risk of spread, however, is low, it added.

Health ministry adds response details

The case that first alerted provincial health officials to a possible Ebola outbreak involved a 65-year-old woman living near Mangina who died at home a few days after she was discharged from Mangina Reference Health Center, the DRC health ministry said in an Aug 4 statement.

After she was buried without precautions being taken, family members who cared for her got sick with the same symptoms, and seven of them died.

Local officials reviewing patient records identified earlier sporadic deaths in the community, and the ministry said investigations are ongoing to determine if there are any epidemiologic links among the cases.

The first Ebola treatment centers will be set up in Mangina, Beni, and Goma, the health ministry said.

Over the weekend the Canadian Doctors Without Borders (MSF) affiliate said on Twitter that it has started its response in Beni and that its teams are working on treatment centers and infection prevention and control. MSF recently played a key role in operating treatment centers in the DRC's outbreak in Equateur province.

In vaccine developments, the ministry said the cold chain needed to store VSV-EBOV doses was slated for deployment over the weekend to Beni, and once conditions reach -70°C (-94°F), the vaccine will be sent there. The country's expanded immunization program has 3,220 doses in stock in Kinshasa.

Suspected case in another DRC province

Meanwhile, health officials in the DRC province of Haute Uele, in the northeastern corner of the country, are investigating a possible Ebola case, according to an African media report translated and posted yesterday by FluTrackers, an infectious disease news message board.

A health official from Watsa territory said a 35-year-old man from city of Durba died on the evening of Aug 3 after experiencing Ebola-like symptoms that included vomiting and bleeding.

Authorities have identified 15 of the man's contacts, have arranged for a safe burial, and sent samples to Beni in North Kivu province for testing.

GOMA, Congo (Reuters) - Health workers in Congo were setting up refrigerators on Monday to keep cool an Ebola vaccine needed to tackle an outbreak suspected to have infected 43 people, the health ministry said.

Giving the latest figures on the epidemic, which was declared just days after an outbreak in northwestern Congo 2,500 miles away was declared over, the ministry said of the 43 suspected cases, 16 were now confirmed. There were three new cases confirmed and four new deaths, as of Monday, it said.

It did not give a total death toll, but previous ministry reports have put deaths at more than 30.

“The cold chain for the vaccinations arrived in Beni on this sixth of August,” the statement said. “Twelve teams of vaccinators will be deployed in the different affected zones.”

The experimental vaccine, which is manufactured by Merck, proved successful during its first wide-scale usage against the outbreak in the northwest.

More than 3,000 doses remain in stock in the capital Kinshasa, allowing authorities to quickly deploy it to the affected areas near the Ugandan border.

The vaccine normally needs to be kept at 80 degrees Celsius below freezing (minus 112 Fahrenheit), although it can be stored for a couple of weeks at just above freezing.","Sponsored by The latest on the Ebola outbreak in the DRC Health officials say they’ve documented 43 cases of Ebola — 13 confirmed and 30 probable — in the new outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Smoke exposure among teens tied to respiratory trouble Teens exposed to tobacco smoke are at an increased risk of experiencing respiratory trouble such as shortness of breath, according to a new study published in Pediatrics. Researchers analyzed health data from 7,389 teens who didn’t smoke or have asthma, but who lived with a smoker, were exposed at home to smoke, or had been exposed to smoke for an hour or more elsewhere within the past week. Smoke exposure was associated with a higher risk of shortness of breath, wheezing during or after exercise, and a dry cough at night. Those potential problems could affect a large number of teens — the researchers estimate that 35 percent of non-smoking, non-asthmatic teens have been exposed to smoke for an hour or more in the past week. How can health care centers become more inclusive? Diversifying the health care workforce is a critical goal in health care centers and schools across the country — and a new study points to ways for health care organizations to improve their own inclusivity. Researchers sent out a call for stories about inclusion — or a lack thereof — to hospitals, health sciences schools, and outpatient facilities in 2016. They got answers from staff, students, faculty, and even a handful of health care execs. Their findings echoed the importance of empowering both bystanders and victims to speak up about discrimination and incivility, educating health care professionals on unconscious biases, and diversifying leadership. New tool captures cell activity with the help of heavy water Scientists have created a cool new imaging tool that aims to track changes in living cells. The tool relies on a substance called heavy water, which is, true to its name, a heavier version of water. It can be metabolized by cells and form bonds with the carbon in protein, lipids, and DNA. When those bonds are hit with light, they vibrate at a unique frequency, which allows researchers to identify whether something is a protein, lipid, or DNA. In new research published in Nature Communications, scientists say they gave mice and roundworms a sip of heavy water, aimed a laser at their tissue, and were able to watch lipids, proteins, and DNA in action.

On Twitter today, Peter Salama, MD, the World Health Organization's (WHO's) deputy director-general of emergency response, said the genetic testing at the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa has confirmed that the Ebola Zaire virus found in North Kivu isn't closely linked to the Equateur outbreak strain, confirming the North Kivu outbreak is a new event.

He also said the confirmation means that responders can start using the VSV-EBOV vaccine, which targets the Ebola Zaire strain, as early as tomorrow.

Oly Ilunga, MD, the DRC's health minister, who also announced the sequencing results on Twitter today, said the country's ethics committee has cleared a plan for vaccination to begin tomorrow. In a separate statement, the health ministry said the first vaccination teams will arrive in Beni tomorrow to vaccinate primary health providers before shifting to contacts and contacts of contacts.

Conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at the INRB on three of the initial patient samples from the North Kivu outbreak highly suggested that the Ebola Zaire strain was the cause of the outbreak, but the WHO had said genetic sequencing is needed to definitively confirm the species.

In briefing notes sent to journalists today, the WHO said the cold chain refrigeration system to store the vaccine arrived in Beni on Aug 5 and will be operational sometime today.

A team of vaccination experts from Guinea will be deployed to help with ring vaccination targeting health workers and contacts, and a revised research and vaccination protocol was expected yesterday. A clinical team with experimental drugs is expected to arrive in the area today.

Three new confirmed cases

In its daily outbreak update, the DRC's health ministry reported 3 more lab-confirmed cases, raising that number to 16. Overall, there are 43 cases, which includes 27 probable cases. Health officials are investigating an additional 46 suspected cases, up from 31 reported the day before.

Two more deaths were reported in confirmed case-patients, one from Beni and one from Mabalako.

Most of the confirmed and probable cases are from five health zones in North Kivu province, but two of the probable cases are from a health zone in neighboring Ituri province, according to the health ministry's report.

Response gains quick traction

In other developments, the WHO said two treatment centers are being set up, one in Beni staffed by Alima and one in Mangina, the outbreak epicenter, covered by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) France.

Safe burials have been conducted in Beni, and systems are being set up to ensure that safe and dignified burials occur in affected health zones, with two sites already covered in Beni and Mangina.

To help minimize the spread to the DRC's neighbors, health officials have notified the governments of Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, and South Sudan about the outbreak and the need for heightened surveillance, especially in areas bordering North Kivu province. The WHO added that response teams have identified 28 key entry points that need beefed up surveillance and capacity to detect and respond to potential new Ebola cases.

In its update, the WHO warned that the cost of the response is likely to be significant, especially given a security situation that involves active armed conflict with rebel fighters and an area that is home to about 1 million displaced people. The group has already released $2 million from its emergency contingency fund.

So far, there are 30 staff in or on their way to Beni, with teams also headed to Mangina, the WHO said.

In the latest outbreak, declared last week, 43 people are believed to have been infected in North Kivu province, including 36 who have died, Congo’s health ministry said on Tuesday.

Forty-six other suspected cases are being investigated, including 25 in Beni, a trading hub of several hundred thousand people, the ministry said in a statement.

Peter Salama, WHO deputy director for emergency preparedness and response, said analysis of genetic sequencing showed it was a new outbreak - separate from the one 2,500 km (1,500 miles) away in the northwest that ended less than two weeks ago after killing 33 - but the same strain.

Oly Ilunga, Congo’s health minister, said in a tweet that an ethics board had approved starting vaccinations on Wednesday. The experimental vaccine, which is manufactured by Merck, proved successful during its first wide-scale usage against the previous outbreak in Equateur Province.

The virus, believed to be carried long distances by bats, poses a high regional risk, WHO has said, noting that Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and South Sudan share borders with eastern Congo.

About 900 contacts of confirmed or suspected cases have been identified for monitoring, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said. The virus causes hemorrhagic fever, vomiting and diarrhea and is spread through direct contact with body fluids.

“Vaccination is expected to start this week and most likely it will start with health workers and responders and then move on to contacts and contacts of contacts,” Jasarevic told a Geneva briefing earlier on Tuesday.

More than 3,000 doses remain in stock in the capital Kinshasa, allowing authorities to deploy them quickly to affected areas.

But they face serious security challenges in eastern Congo, a tinderbox of conflicts over land and ethnicity stoked by decades of on-off war.

Local authorities announced on Tuesday that 14 bodies had been discovered in the town of Tubameme, about 40 km (25 miles) northeast of the epicenter of the outbreak in the town of Mangina. Activists in the area said they had been kidnapped by Ugandan Islamist rebels last week.

About 1,000 civilians have been killed by armed groups and state forces around Beni in a wave of massacres since late 2014, although the immediate area around Mangina has been largely spared.

A U.N. peacekeeping mission known as MONUSCO is assessing the situation and has sent ‘security-enhanced vehicles’ for possible use in the vaccination program, Jasarevic said.

Poison control calls for unapproved drug spike Calls to U.S. poison control centers about an unapproved antidepressant that has opioid-like effects have climbed dramatically since 2015, public health researchers warn in a new report. Here’s the rundown: The backstory: Tianeptine hasn’t been approved by the FDA, but it’s easy to buy online and is sometimes abused. Michigan reclassified tianeptine as a Schedule II controlled substance after a series of overdoses.

The finding: From 2000 to 2017, there were 218 calls related to tianeptine exposure recorded in the National Poison Data System. The spike followed a 2014 paper that showed that the drug works on the opioid receptors, so it can produce a high.

The context: “In light of the ongoing U.S. opioid epidemic, any emerging trends in drugs with opioid-like effects raise concerns about potential abuse and public health safety,” the authors write. Here's what will make the Ebola response challenging, according to the WHO The new Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo could be much more complex to contain than the outbreak that was just declared over. But it might also give the world another shot at testing an experimental vaccine. Here’s what the WHO's Dr. Peter Salama told STAT about what lies ahead. What are the challenges of this outbreak? The real complexity here is security and the corollary, displacement. It is one of the most insecure provinces in DRC. And there's a million displaced people in North Kivu. So this is going to be — believe it or not — much more complex, I think, and much tougher than the last outbreak to contain. How will that affect the operation? Last time, we had 300 WHO staff on the ground for a large period of the response. Here it's going to be very different. We're discussing with the U.N. what the security ceiling will be for the number of staff that they'll allow us to deploy. … And that's going to make it much more difficult. Scientists probe link between obesity and flu's spread A new study suggests obesity extends how long the influenza A virus is shed from infected adults. Viral shedding serves as a measure for how long a person with flu might be infectious to others. The study, funded by the NIH, monitored 1,783 people in Nicaragua over the three flu seasons between 2015 and 2017. Adults with obesity and two or more symptoms of influenza A shed the virus 5.2 days, on average, compared to 3.7 days among non-obese adults. Obesity didn’t seem to extend viral shedding for kids or adults with influenza B.

Researchers tested thalidomide on embryonic stem cells and found it degrades some transcription factors — proteins that help flip genes on or off — including one called SALL4. It's long been a likely suspect. That's because mutations in the SALL4 gene are also tied to a rare disease that can lead to underdeveloped limbs, eye and ear defects, and heart issues — the hallmark signs of exposure to thalidomide in the womb.

The nationwide Healthy People 2020 initiative outlined specific goals to prepare school systems to respond to and recover from natural disasters, infectious diseases, and other threats. In tracking whether schools are making progress on those policies, researchers found that roughly three-quarters of districts have plans to address students’ mental health needs and reunify students with their parents in the event of an emergency.

One week after the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) health ministry declared a new outbreak in the east of the country, an immunization campaign began today, which targeted frontline health workers from the Mangina Reference Health Center, the epicenter of the outbreak, who had been in contact with confirmed cases and their contacts.

Vaccinators were Congolese workers who had been trained by teams from Guinea during the Equateur province outbreak, which was declared over in late July, according to a health ministry statement. Several teams from Guinea will return to the DRC to help with vaccination in the latest outbreak.

DRC Health Minister Oly Ilunga, MD, visited the Mangina outbreak areas today, and the provincial health minister and province's immunization coordinator were among the first to be vaccinated, a step done to reassure residents about the safety of the vaccine.

In other outbreak developments, one more Ebola case was confirmed. The overall total is now 44, which included 17 confirmed and 27 probable cases. Health officials are investigating an additional 47 cases. So far 36 deaths have been reported.

WHO details 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks in Nigeria

The World Health Organization (WHO) said today that Nigeria is experiencing two separate circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreaks.

One of the events is based on 10 environmental samples collected from Jan 30 to May 23 from two collection sites in Sokoto state, according to the WHO statement. So far no associated cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have been found that are related to the environmental detections.

In a separate outbreak, cVDPV2 was found in a stool sample from a patient in Yobe state and in an environmental sample collected on May 31. The patient's AFP symptoms began on Jun 16. The WHO said the same virus was found in Gombe state from an environmental sample collected on Apr 9 and in Jigawa state from an AFP patient whose symptoms began Apr 15 and in six environmental samples collected from Jan 10 to May 2.

Detailed investigations were conducted following the detection of the AFP cases and environmental positives. In response to the dual outbreaks, health officials conducted a vaccination drive with monovalent oral type 2 vaccine that targeted 54 local government areas in Jigwa, Bauchi, Gombe, and Sokoto states. Other response steps include enhanced surveillance and stepped-up routine immunization activities.

A WHO risk assessment done before the outbreak response started determined a high risk of spread of the two outbreak virus strains. The agency urges countries, especially those with frequent travel to and contacts with polio-affected countries, to strengthen their surveillance for AFP and maintain high vaccination coverage.

Italy moves to overturn mandatory childhood vaccinations

Despite an increase in measles outbreaks, Italy's upper house of government voted this week to eliminate a law that requires children to have 10 common vaccines before starting school.

According to the British newspaper The Independent,the law was put in place in March after 4 people died and 5,000 were infected in a nationwide measles outbreak. At that time, only four vaccines, not including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, were required before school admittance.

But growing pressure from a strong anti-vaccine movement led the Five Star Movement and the League (two political parties) led the upper house to take up the legislation.

Deputy prime minister and leader of the League, Matteo Salvini, said that having 10 compulsory vaccines is ""useless and sometimes dangerous,"" according to the story.

The 10-vaccine law stands, however, until a forthcoming lower house vote.

WHO officially declares India's 19-case Nipah outbreak over

The Nipah outbreak in India's Kerala state appears to be over, as there have been no new deaths or cases reported since Jun 1, according to an update from the WHO yesterday. As noted previously, a total of 19 people contracted the virus, and there were 17 deaths attributed to the deadly emerging infectious disease.

Only two patients recovered completely and have been discharged from the hospital. The outbreak affected only Kerala, where the earliest patients in May first became sick after entering a well that was populated with fruit bats.

""Acute respiratory distress syndrome and encephalitis were observed among the patients infected. This was the first NiV outbreak reported in Kerala State and the third NiV outbreak known to have occurred in India; the two previous outbreaks occurred in the state of West Bengal in 2001 and 2007,"" said the WHO.

The WHO estimates Nipah's case-fatality rate to be between 40% and 75%. Though human-to-human transmission can occur, the disease is most commonly spread via consumption of fruit contaminated by the saliva of infected bats, or from direct contact with infected bats or their feces or urine. There are no treatments available for Nipah.

Aug 7 WHO update",no result found,no result found,"MANGINA, Congo (Reuters) - Congolese officials and the World Health Organization began vaccinating health workers against the deadly Ebola virus on Wednesday, to try to halt an outbreak in Congo’s volatile east.

A Reuters witness on a visit to Mangina, the village in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where the epidemic was declared, saw health workers in protective suits administering the injections.

So far 43 people are believed to have been infected in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, including 36 who have died, the health ministry said on Tuesday.

“We are putting all our energy and all our expertise to quickly control this epidemic,” Health Minister Oly Ilunga told journalists at the start of the vaccination campaign.

“All the measures of prevention are in place. The vaccination is the last phase. It will enable us to break the chain of transmission of this epidemic.”

More than 900 contacts of those infected have been identified for monitoring, although security is an issue in the area where militia groups operate, WHO said..

The disease, which causes fever, vomiting and diarrhea, is spread through direct contact with body fluids.

“Around 40 health workers are expected to be vaccinated today; by end of the week, once all the necessary steps are in place, vaccination of community contacts and their contacts will commence,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said.

WHO has said that analysis of genetic sequencing showed it was a separate outbreak from the one 2,500 km (1,500 miles) away in the northwest that ended less than two weeks ago after killing 33 people — but the same Zaire strain.

This is Congo’s 10th Ebola outbreak since the virus was first identified near northern Congo’s Ebola river.

“There is a huge fear among the local population,” Kaswera Mathumo, a medical worker at a clinic in Mangina, where the vaccinations were taking place, said.

The experimental vaccine being used, which is manufactured by Merck, proved successful during its first wide-scale usage against the previous outbreak in Equateur Province.

More than 3,000 doses remain in stock in the capital Kinshasa, allowing authorities to deploy them quickly to affected areas.

But they face security challenges in eastern Congo, a region bubbling with conflicts over land and ethnicity stoked by decades of on-off war.

Local authorities announced on Tuesday that 14 bodies had been discovered in the town of Tubameme, about 40 km (25 miles) northeast of the epicenter of the outbreak in the town of Mangina, suspected to have been killed by a militia group.","A man displays an Ebola information leaflet for residents in Mangina, Democratic Republic of Congo, on Wednesday.

DAKAR, Senegal — Ebola vaccinations began Wednesday in Congo’s latest outbreak of the deadly virus that has already claimed at least nine lives.

Health officials have warned that containing the outbreak in North Kivu province is complicated by the presence of multiple armed groups vying for mineral-rich land in the northeastern region that borders Uganda and Rwanda.

The latest outbreak, declared Aug. 1 in Mangina village in the Mabalako health zone, is Congo’s tenth outbreak since the virus was identified in 1976. This outbreak has seen 16 confirmed Ebola cases, 27 probable cases, and 46 suspected ones.

Some 36 people have died from hemorrhagic fever amid the outbreak, but officials said many cannot be confirmed as Ebola deaths at this point.

Three thousand doses of the Ebola vaccine are being sent from Kinshasa, the capital, and will be used first in the Mabalako health zone and in the nearby city of Beni, which has more than 680,000 people.

The experimental vaccine was used in an earlier, unrelated outbreak in Congo’s northwest that was declared over last month.

The first to be vaccinated are health workers, contacts of confirmed Ebola cases and their contacts in what is called a ring vaccination campaign. The strategy is the same that was used to contain the previous outbreak in Equateur province, with more than 3,300 people vaccinated.

The first people to be vaccinated on Wednesday included the Beni’s region chief doctor and medical staff. Other residents in Beni and Mangina will receive vaccinations Thursday, authorities said.

“I will be very content to receive the vaccination tomorrow,” said Solange Mbambu. “When I see the doctors preparing the funerals for those who have died from Ebola, without their family, it gives me goose bumps.”

Ebola jumps to humans from animals including bats and monkeys. It can be spread through contact of bodily fluids of someone infected, living or dead. There is no specific treatment, and the virus can be fatal in up to 90 percent of cases, depending on the strain.

Genetic analysis confirmed the virus strain in this latest outbreak is the Zaire one.

9-Aug-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

On 1 August 2018, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease in North Kivu Province, in the eastern part of the country. North Kivu is among the most populated provinces in the country, shares borders with Uganda and Rwanda, and experiences conflict and insecurity, with over one million internally displaced people and migration of refugees to neighbouring countries.

The Ministry of Health, WHO and partners are continuing to strengthen activities across all key response pillars. As of 7 August 2018, 44 Ebola virus disease cases (17 confirmed and 27 probable), including 36 deaths, have been reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. This includes sporadic, antecedent deaths in affected communities since May 2018, which were identified from clinical records and tentatively classified as probable cases pending further investigations. Two healthcare workers (one confirmed and one probable) have been affected, of which one has died. Confirmed or probable cases are localised to five health zones in North Kivu, and one neighbouring health zone in Ituri Province. The majority of cases (13 confirmed, 21 probable) have been reported from Mabalako Health Zone (Figure 1). An additional 47 suspected cases are currently pending laboratory testing to confirm or exclude Ebola virus disease.

On 6 August 2018, the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) confirmed by genetic sequencing that this latest outbreak is caused by the Zaire ebolavirus species, and is not related to the recent outbreak in Équateur Province.

For more information, see:

Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 7 August 2018

Public health response

The Ministry of Health has initiated response mechanisms in North Kivu and Ituri provinces with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include the establishment and strengthening of surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

On 2 August 2018, the Minister of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the WHO Representative and representatives of several partner agencies visited Mabalako Health Zone (the epicentre of the outbreak) and Beni to assess and support the local response.

The Ministry of Health and WHO have deployed Rapid Response Teams to the affected health zones to initiate response activities. As of 7 August, WHO has deployed 30 technical and logistics specialists to support response activities. Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions continue to support the WHO response to Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as ongoing readiness and preparedness activities in non-affected provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in nine bordering countries.

On 8 August, the vaccination of frontline health care workers started, followed by the vaccination of community contacts and their contacts. There are currently 3220 doses of rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine available in Kinshasa. A clinical team with therapeutics arrived on 7 August.

Ebola treatment centres have been established in Mangina and Beni, with the support of international partners. The deployment of experienced clinicians to support partners in caring for patients is in process.

On 3 August 2018, two GeneXpert machines were set up in Beni to facilitate the timely diagnosis of suspected cases. The establishment of additional laboratory capacity elsewhere is being explored, including additional GeneXpert machines in Mangina, Goma and other areas as needed. The INRB is working to deploy additional diagnostic capacities in Mangina, including conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), serology, haematology and biochemistry.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is supporting the Democratic Republic of the Congo Red Cross to establish systems to ensure safe and dignified burials throughout the affected zones. Currently, two teams are operating from Beni and are covering the affected areas.

The WHO Regional Emergency Director for Africa has informed neighbouring countries (Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, and South Sudan) of the outbreak and emphasized the need for heightened surveillance and preparedness actions in the respective countries, particularly along the border with North Kivu.

Thirty-two key points of entry have been identified in which to strengthen capacity to rapidly detect and respond to potential new Ebola virus disease cases and to engage communities along border areas to improve knowledge of Ebola virus disease and its prevention.

Activities to sensitize communities to the outbreak began in affected communities through the Social Mobilization Commission, and in neighbouring Uganda and Rwanda. WHO and partners have held a series of briefings with community and neighbourhood leaders, teachers, religious leaders, journalists, and community groups to raise awareness about Ebola, including information on the current outbreak and preventive measures.

As of 8 August, three charter cargo planes from Mbandaka arrived in Beni with a total of 23 tonnes of supplies. A further charter is scheduled to depart Dubai with 20 000 sets of viral haemorrhagic fever Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and 50 000 sets of standard PPE.

WHO risk assessment

This latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease is affecting north eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which are in close proximity to Uganda. Potential risk factors for transmission of Ebola virus disease at national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing several epidemics and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu may hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public health risk is considered high at the national and regional levels and low globally.

WHO advice

As investigations continue to establish the full extent of this outbreak, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure health authorities are alerted and are prepared to respond.

WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event.

For more information, see:","Ebola Situation on Thursday August 9, 2018 A total of 44 cases including 17 confirmed and 27 probable 54 cases httpstco2KSA7bHT5s",no result found,"In an update today on the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) health ministry said the number of cases remained at 44, including 17 confirmed and 27 probable cases, but it said 54 suspected cases are being investigated, up from 47 in yesterday's report.

One more death has been reported in a confirmed case-patient, raising that total to 37.

Samples from two suspected cases in Goma, the provincial capital, were negative for the virus. Also, a sample from a suspected case in the Haut-Uele province town of Watsa, reported a few days ago by the African media, were negative.

The health ministry said officials are putting contingency plans in place in Goma, in case the virus reaches the city. Elements of the plan include identifying an isolation unit at the city's North Kivu Provincial Hospital, putting border officers at city entry points, and beginning social mobilization activities.

CDC experts deployed

In related developments, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today that it has deployed Ebola experts to the DRC and the World Health Organization to provide guidance on outbreak response coordination, lab testing, contact tracing, infection control, and health communication.

The CDC added that it will provide additional assistance as needed, including support with vaccination.

Also, the CDC yesterday issued a level 1 (watch-level) travel notice for Ebola in the DRC. It urges travelers to avoid infected people's blood and body fluids.

The CDC does not recommend that people avoid travel to the DRC. The CDC's notice, however, says that the State Department has identified the North Kivu area as a ""reconsider travel"" zone because of armed group activity and violent outbreaks targeting citizens.

The latest confirmed cases near the town of Mangina in Congo’s North Kivu province bring the total for the current outbreak to 21, the ministry said in a statement late on Friday.

Two more people - one near Mangina and another in the city of Beni - died of Ebola, the ministry said. In all, the haemorrhagic fever is believed to have killed 38 people, although several of these cases have not been confirmed.

Authorities this week began vaccinating health workers and people who had contact with confirmed cases. The experimental vaccine, manufactured by Merck, proved effective against an outbreak in western Congo that ended late last month.

Officials are also ready to use an experimental treatment called mAB114 on Ebola patients for the first time, Steve Ahuka, a virologist at the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) in the capital Kinshasa, told Reuters.

The treatment was developed in the United States using the antibodies of the survivor of an Ebola outbreak in the western Congolese city of Kikwit in 1995 and was 100 percent effective when tested on monkeys.

“It’s experimental. So we are following the protocol. It has been submitted to the ethical committee and the ethical committee gave its okay,” Ahuka said, adding it could be used within days.

He said other experimental treatments, including ZMapp, a similar antibody drug made by Mapp Biopharmaceuticals in San Diego, could also be used.

Ebola, which causes fever, vomiting and diarrhea, is spread through direct contact with body fluids.

It killed more than 11,000 people during the largest-ever outbreak in West Africa from 2013-16. Authorities in Congo, which has experienced 10 outbreaks since 1976, have been more successful in containing it.

But the current flare-up poses fresh challenges as it is in a part of Congo stalked by myriad militia groups that regularly battle one another and kill and kidnap civilians.

According to an update yesterday, the outbreak total has risen to 52 cases, reflecting 25 confirmed and 27 probable cases. In addition, health officials are investigating 48 suspected infections. Two more deaths have been reported, lifting the fatality count to 39.

WHO mission highlights complex security issues

In a statement yesterday, the WHO said over a 2-day visit in the outbreak zone that was accompanied by the DRC health ministry, the group's leadership saw first-hand the complexities responders face in implementing Ebola activities in North Kivu province. They visited the city of Beni and the Mangina health area, the location of most confirmed cases reported so far.

A range of armed groups are active in the area, creating challenging security issued for health teams who need to go deep into communities to identify and monitor possible cases, the WHO said. Conflict settings can also discourage community members from coming forward for treatment.

The health ministry outbreak said in its response plan, posted by the WHO on Aug 10, that the far northern part of North Kivu province is relatively peaceful, but the situation near the outbreak area is unpredictable. The area dominated by armed conflict with a risk of deliberate attacks and acts of hostility against facilities, personnel, and property during times of tension. North Kivu—home to 8 million people—is one of the DRC's most densely populated provinces.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, the WHO's director-general, said, ""All of those participating in the response must be able to more freely and safety in conflict areas to do the work that is needed to bring the outbreak under control. The population must also have access to treatment centers that save lives and stop the spread of the disease.""

Health worker exposures raise worries of worsening outbreak phase

Of the 8 latest confirmed cases reported since Aug 9 by the health ministry, 5 are from Mabalako, two are from Mangina, and 1 is from Beni.

One of the cases from Mangina reported yesterday is a health worker from the Mangina Reference Health Center, the health ministry said in its statement yesterday. About 74 of the health center's staff members have been identified as contacts of Ebola cases have been have been temporarily discharged and will be monitored for 21 days, the health ministry said in its Aug 11 statement.

As another response step, the ministry said it has finalized a plan through a World Bank-funded project to offer free healthcare in three health zones around the outbreak epicenter—Mabalako, Blessed, and Oicha—to remove financial barriers to care and encourage resident to seek care as soon as the first Ebola symptoms appear.

In Twitter posts today, Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's deputy director-general of emergency response, said sadly, many health workers in Mangina were exposed to Ebola early in the outbreak. And since health worker infections are known to amplify Ebola outbreaks, health officials expect the current DRC outbreak to get worse before it gets better. ""Given complexities, we ask all partners to support government-led response with their most experienced staff,"" he said.

Salama said the event is on an ""epidemiological precipice"" and that there's a crucial time-limited window of opportunity to prevent the Ebola outbreak from taking hold in areas that are much more difficult to access due to security concerns. ""There is not a minute to lose,"" he said.

Authorities to deploy experimental antibody treatment

Health officials are preparing to use an experimental antibody treatment called mAB114 in the latest outbreak Steve Ahuka, MD, PhD, a virologist from the DRC's National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) told Reuters on Aug 11.

The monoclonal antibody treatment was developed in the United States and is based on antibodies of a patient who survived Ebola during an outbreak in the DRC city of Kikwit in 1995, according to the Reuters report. Ahuka said the DRC's ethical committee has approved the use of mAB114 and that it could be used within days. He also said other experimental treatments could also be used.

mAb114 was one of five experimental treatments that the DRC health ministry ethics committee approved for compassionate use during the earlier outbreak, pending finalized study protocol details. In May, a WHO expert group evaluated five therapies—including mAb114—that could be used in the earlier DRC outbreak. It said though early data on mAB114 look promising, more were needed before recommending it for compassionate use.

Remaining vaccine questions, immune response after natural infection

Key scientific questions remain in efforts to develop a safe and effective Ebola vaccine, according to scientists from the Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccination (PREVAC) who wrote a perspective piece that appeared in the Aug 10 issue of The Lancet. The team is currently conducting a phase 2 trials in West Africa to evaluate three Ebola vaccination strategies in people age 1 year and older.

In reviewing the status of the wider research landscape, they said 36 trials of Ebola vaccine candidates have been completed and another 14 are active. Focusing on four vaccine candidates (Ad26-ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo, chAD3-EBOV, and GamEvac-Combi), they said more data are needed in pregnant women, children, and people with immune compromise, including those with HIV and the elderly. Also, they note that more research is needed on the durability and speed of immune responses prompted by the different vaccine approaches. The team also called for studies to identify correlated of protection and large-scale trials to fully gauge safety and efficacy of the experimental vaccines.

In other medical literature developments, tests on the blood of 15 Ebola survivors found that antibodies from some of them neutralized Ebola viruses from four different strains, as well as Marburg virus. Writing in the Journal of Infectious Diseases today, a team from the United States and the DRC they described the experiments they did on the blood of survivors of a 2014 the DRC. Three survivors had a strong response against four filovirus glycoproteins, including that of Marburg virus.

Though they said the mechanism of action of the response requires further study, the data suggest that a pan-filovirus vaccine might be achievable and that it might be possible to isolate human monoclonal antibodies that neutralized all filoviruses.

FDA approves landmark drug and controversial app The FDA had a busy Friday, with several big approvals worth noting. Here’s the rundown: A landmark approval: The agency approved a landmark rare disease treatment from Alnylam to treat nerve damage. It's the first approved drug to rely on a technique called RNA interference, which silences disease-causing genes.

A comeback: Amicus Therapeutics won FDA approval for Galafold, a drug that treats a rare and sometimes fatal condition. Just two years ago, the drug's potential in the U.S. looked uncertain after the FDA asked for more patient data. But in 2017, the agency agreed to consider the drug based on existing data.

A controversial app: The FDA cleared a controversial pregnancy prevention app, which uses basal temperature to estimate ovulation. Some people have expressed concern it’s not reliable enough to use as birth control. Earlier this year, Swedish regulators announced they were investigating the app after dozens of women using it accidentally became pregnant.

Researchers ran a review of nearly 100 studies that looked at the issue of low-quality or counterfeit drugs in low- and middle-income countries. All together, the studies suggested that 19 percent of malaria drugs and 12 percent of antibiotics in low- and middle-income countries are fake or aren't of a good quality. But the economic toll of the issue isn't clear — estimates ranged from $10 billion to $200 billion. The authors say their findings show it’s essential to better study the scope of counterfeit drugs and pinpoint the best ways to tackle the threat.

In a bid to increase HPV vaccination rates, some states have passed laws offering school-based education programs and other incentives. Researchers compared changes in sexual behaviors among high school students before and after HPV laws to changes in behavior in states without HPV laws. They didn't find a difference. Their conclusion: Concerns about risky sexual activity more likely shouldn’t be used as an argument against HPV vaccine legislation.

14-Aug-18,"Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo – Operational readiness and preparedness in neighbouring countries

Following the declaration on 1 August 2018 of a new Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO conducted a formal rapid risk assessment, which determined that the public health risk for this outbreak is high at the regional level. This assessment took into consideration that, with eight million inhabitants, North Kivu is one of the most densely populated provinces in the country. North Kivu borders four other provinces (Ituri, South Kivu, Maniema and Tshopo), as well as Uganda and Rwanda. Moreover, the province has been experiencing intense insecurity and a deteriorating humanitarian crisis, with over one million internally displaced people and high rates of cross border movement to and from neighbouring countries.

On 5 May 2018, during the previous EVD outbreak in Équateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, the WHO Regional Office for Africa identified nine neighbouring countries (Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia and Uganda), where Preparation Support Teams were deployed to assess countries’ readiness using the WHO standardized checklist, and to provide technical support to countries to develop and initiate national contingency plans in collaboration with partners.

Currently for the EVD outbreak in North Kivu, the WHO Regional Office for Africa has prioritized four of the nine countries (Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda) neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the Congo to enhance operational readiness and preparedness (Figure 1). These four countries were prioritised based on their capacity to manage EVD and viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) outbreaks, and their proximity to the areas currently reporting EVD cases. In addition, Kinshasa, Mai-Ndombe, Tshuapa, Tshopo, South Kivu, Ituri, Bas-Uélé, Sankuru and Maniema provinces were prioritized for readiness activities. This update will primarily focus on the four of the nine priority countries.

Figure 1: Countries identified for enhanced operational readiness and preparedness activities

WHO is deploying Preparedness Support Teams to these and other neighbouring countries, as was done during the previous EVD outbreak in Équateur Province. These missions aim to assess countries’ readiness using a WHO checklist and to provide technical support to countries to develop and implement national contingency plans in collaboration with partners. The operational and preparedness activities will focus on the following thematic areas:

Coordination:

WHO has established a network of health and non-health partners that are supporting countries to implement and scale up preparedness and readiness activities.

The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) continues to support these activities. Experts in laboratory, case management, surveillance, clinical management, infection prevention and control (IPC), and risk communication have been requested and are being deployed systematically.

The United States Centre for Disease Control (CDC) has deployed experts to Geneva to support WHO Headquarters team working on the response. The United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) and International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) are deploying senior coordinators to liaise with the WHO Headquarters team in Geneva.

WHO is working with experts from Emergency Medical Teams to support training and strengthen case management readiness.

Five teams from the Stop Transmission of Polio Program were repurposed to provide support in Uganda.

Burundi has established an EVD coordination committee and commissioned seven sub-committees for monitoring EVD activities based on the standardized WHO checklist.

In Rwanda, an Ebola partners’ coordination forum was established to support preparedness activities.

Surveillance:

All targeted countries have implemented heightened surveillance and are readily detecting and investigating alert and suspected VHF cases.

The national electronic Early Warning Alert and Response (EWAR) system in Rwanda continues to be used to detect suspected VHF cases.

Rapid response teams (RRTs):

In July 2018, joint RRTs in Uganda was trained incoordination, surveillance, risk communication and potential case investigations. Several teams from this training were deployed on 2 August 2018 to four high-risk areas in Uganda: Kabarole (Fort Portal), Kasese, Ntoroko and Bundibugyo.

By 10 August, RRTs were in place in all four priority countries: Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda and Burundi. Plans are being developed for a multidisciplinary rapid response training in Rwanda.

Points of entry (POEs):

The Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is strengthening surveillance capacities in 18 international POEs in North Kivu. Similar efforts will also be made at POEs in other vulnerable provinces. More than 30 additional points of internal connection for travellers, migrants and displaced people were identified; similar surveillance activities are ongoing at these points, including hand hygiene, traveller screening, management of alerts, and risk communication. The MoH will also enhance surveillance activities at refugee transit centers and other congregation sites.

Points of entry screening have been identified and implemented in the following neighbouring countries: Burundi, Central African Republic, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda and Zambia.

Laboratory:

An initial 25 rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were sent to Rwanda. A further 50 RDTs and additional resources will be sent to strengthen laboratory capacity.

Of the four prioritized countries, only Uganda has the laboratory capacity to test for EVD and other VHFs by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The remaining three countries have the capacity to test using RDTs and have mechanisms in place to send samples to a WHO reference laboratory. However, two laboratory experts from CDC will be arriving in Rwanda on 15 August 2018 to support the MoH for laboratory activities and preparedness.

In South Sudan, WHO has trained 20 medical laboratory staff on biosafety and EVD diagnostic testing and has also provided probes for EVD testing using GeneXpert.

Case management and IPC

Expert networks of case management and IPC specialists have been alerted to the request for assistance for operational readiness and preparedness in non-Ebola affected provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries.

Posters for how to identify EVD symptoms are available at health care facilities in English (Uganda and Rwanda), and French (Rwanda and Burundi).

The WHO Emerging Diseases Clinical Assessment and Response Network (EDCARN) member IMAI-IMCI alliance hosted a clinical training for health care workers in Uganda earlier this year.

All four prioritized countries have identified health facilities that will be used to for the isolation and treatment of suspected cases.

Risk communication:

As of June 2018, 32 risk communicators were trained in Uganda; additional risk communication activities have been initiated.

Risk communication messages in Rwanda have been disseminated through national radio and television broadcasts.

Training on risk communication for both EVD and Rift Valley fever (RVF) are planned in South Sudan.

The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross have invested in risk communication, community mobilization and IPC in the Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic.

Logistics

Uganda has been equipped with five VHF kits, 25 RDTs, chlorine, personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and 58 digital infrared thermometers have been prepositioned in high-risk districts.

PPE kits, thermoflash and RDTs have been prepositioned in all surrounding countries in preparation for suspected cases.

The World Food Programme (WFP) has provided support with logistics, transportation and food in the Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic.

WHO Regional Strategic Plan for EVD Operational Readiness and Preparedness

The aforementioned activities are in addition to the operational readiness and preparedness activities already underway in response to the previous outbreak in Équateur Province. Early this year, WHO and partners, in collaboration with country ministries of health, developed a nine-month (June 2018 – February 2019) Strategic Plan1 , which aims to align activities and ensure that the countries bordering the Democratic Republic of the Congo are prepared and operationally ready to implement timely and effective risk mitigation, detection and response measures should suspected EVD cases be detected. The findings of the WHO Preparedness Support Team missions helped to identify key challenges and priorities as well as informed the development of the national EVD contingency plans.

Under the leadership of the Ministries of Health, preparedness activities are already being implemented in the nine countries with technical and financial support provided by national budgets, WHO and partners. In response to the specific risks posed by the current outbreak, Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda will be reclassified as Priority 1 countries under a revised plan which is being finalized.

WHO advice

As the MoH, WHO and partners strengthen response activities to control the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to continue to enhance operational readiness and preparedness activities.

WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to monitor and verify, if necessary, travel and trade measures in relation to this event.

The other is a patient recently treated at that facility.

The batch of new cases puts the outbreak total at 57, which now exceeds the 54 illnesses reported in recent Equateur province outbreak, which was declared over just a week before officials announced the latest outbreak.

In other developments, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, today filled reporters in on a visit he and his colleagues made to the new outbreak zone and warned that inaccessible ""red zones"" due to armed conflict might be hiding places for the Ebola virus and make it difficult for responders to enter and for infected residents to seek outside help.

""I was worried before I got there,"" he said of the area, which he said is home to more than 100 armed groups and has experienced about 120 violent attacks since January. ""After the visit, I am even more worried.""

Tedros said the night his delegation stayed in Beni, an incident took place about 9 miles away, which resulted in the killing of four civilians with a number of people kidnapped.

Infection patterns also show more illnesses in women and children

According to the DRC health ministry's daily update, the 57 Ebola cases includes 30 confirmed and 27 probable cases. Also, health officials are investigating 58 suspected cases, up from 45 reported on Aug 12. Two more deaths were reported, pushing the total number to 41.

Besides the four new confirmed cases among health workers from Mangina Reference Health Center, there is one new confirmed case in a man from neighboring Ituri province who had been treated for heart problems at Mangina Reference Health Center. He died after returning to his village in Ituri, which is a short distance from Mangina.

Yesterday, the WHO signaled that it was worried about early exposure in healthcare workers and warned that, given the amplifying effect sick healthcare workers have on spread of the disease, the outbreak could get worse before it gets better.

At today's briefing, Tedros said 7 health workers are among the confirmed Ebola cases and that as a precaution, all 74 of the facility's workers are considered contacts and are under home monitoring. He noted that replacement workers have already been provided to staff the treatment center.

He said there are several features of the North Kivu outbreak that are different than the recent event in Equateur province, including high population density and population movement, high numbers of displaced people, armed conflict in the area, and a different Ebola genotype. Another, Tedros said, is high numbers of infected women and children. He said the pattern could be due to women's responsibilities as caregivers and the dependence of children on women. However, he said other factors may be in play, such as cultural factors, which require further investigation.

Vaccination strategy could change

In a vaccination update, Tedros said 216 health workers have received the VSV-EBOV vaccine and that 20 people from the community have also been immunized.

Health officials are hoping to speed up deployment of the vaccine, he said, adding that experienced immunization teams from Guinea arrived in Kinshasa yesterday and are expected to be on the ground in Beni and Mangina today.

So far, responders are sticking with the ring vaccination strategy, which targets contacts of confirmed cases and the contacts of the contacts, he said. However, depending on how events unfold, officials may need to consider other strategies.

Given the high numbers of healthcare worker infected in Mangina, Tedros said health officials have proposed vaccinating the entire community of about 1,200 people to more quickly contain the virus.

There are about 3,000 doses of vaccine in the DRC, and up to 300,000 doses are available on short notice, he said. ""We are OK, we are comfortable,"" he said of the vaccine supply situation.

First patients get experimental treatment

In another new development, the DRC's health ministry said health teams have started using the experimental monoclonal antibody treatment mAb114 in treatment centers in Beni and Mangina, making it the first experimental therapy to be used in an active Ebola outbreak in the DRC.

In the earlier outbreak this year, the ministry's scientific and ethics committees approved the use of five experimental therapies, which included mAb114. At the start of the North Kivu outbreak, the country's National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) asked the makers of all five therapies to reauthorize their use and amend treatment protocols for the ethics committee to review again.

Supplies of all treatments have arrived in Beni, except for ZMapp, which must be stored at -20°C (-4°F).

The ethics committee has already cleared mAb114 for use, and the other four have just been submitted to the group for reconsideration, according to the health ministry.

At today's briefing, Tedros said five patients have already received mAb114. He added that the INRB and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) had launched a study of the treatment in May.

The monoclonal antibody is based on antibodies of a patient who survived Ebola in the DRC city of Kikwit in 1995. A WHO expert committee in May evaluated five experimental Ebola therapies, including mAb114. It said early data on the treatment looked promising, but more were needed before recommending it for compassionate use.

Aug 13 CIDRAP News story ""Worries about security and healthcare exposures as DRC Ebola total grows to 52""",no result found,no result found,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo/GENEVA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo has started using the experimental mAb114 Ebola treatment to counter the latest flare-up of the virus, health officials said on Tuesday, the first time it has been deployed against an active outbreak.

Forty-two people are believed to have died from the haemorrhagic fever in Congo’s tenth Ebola outbreak since it was discovered in the 1970s.

In all, there have been 66 cases to date, including 39 confirmed and 27 probable, the health ministry said on Tuesday evening, an increase of nine confirmed cases since Monday.

The outbreak has spread from its epicenter in North Kivu province to neighboring Ituri province after an infected person returned home, Congo’s health ministry said, complicating containment in a region beset by militia violence.

Ebola, which causes fever, vomiting and diarrhea, finds a natural home in Congo’s vast equatorial forests. Continuing flare-ups have made the central African country a testing ground for new treatments against a virus that between 2013 and 2016 killed more than 11,300 people in a West African epidemic.

In an outbreak in western Congo which began in April and was declared over in July, an experimental vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co Inc was given to 3,300 people and was considered central in containing the virus when it reached a city.

The mAb114 treatment was developed in the United States by the National Institutes of Health using the antibodies of the survivor of an Ebola outbreak in the western Congolese city of Kikwit in 1995.

World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva that medics were already treating five patients with mAb114 and that he had been informed they were doing well.

“We will use it as much as needed,” Tedros said. “But use of the molecules is decided by doctor and patient consent.”

Several other experimental treatments have arrived in the regional hub of Beni and are awaiting approval from an ethics committee, including Remdesivir, Favipiravir and REGN3450, REGN3471 and REGN3479, the health ministry said.

Separately, authorities have vaccinated more than 200 health workers and contacts of Ebola patients. He said the risk of international spread was currently considered low even though it poses a high regional risk because of its proximity to the Ugandan border, which is only about 100 km (60 miles) away.

The response is taking place against the backdrop of insecurity caused by dozens of militia groups who regularly kill and kidnap civilians in the region.

“Before I went there I was really worried because of the different nature of the Ebola outbreak in DRC,” Tedros said. “But after the visit I am actually more worried because of what we have observed there first hand.”

The cases expand the number of cases in neighboring Ituri province.

Yesterday, the DRC said a man from Ituri had contracted Ebola and had been treated for heart problems at Mangina Reference Hospital. He died upon his return home.

Outbreak total now stands at 66, which includes 39 confirmed and 27 probable cases. Lab testing results have brought the suspected number of cases down to 36 from 58.

North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in DRC, with 8 million inhabitants. Ituri, South Kivu, Maniema and Tshopo are neighboring regions, and home to an additional 1 million displaced persons. The area is a hothouse of rebel activity.

Yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) addressed the risk of violence workers face as they try to contain the outbreak in the region, which has been described as a ""war zone.""

Surveillance at entry points increases

According to the latest situation report published by the WHO, a total of 990 contacts are under surveillance in Mabalako (790), Beni (141) and Mandima (59) health zones as of Aug 11. Of these, 129 are healthcare workers. So far, eight healthcare workers have contracted the virus, and one has died.

Today the WHO detailed the surveillance and preparedness plans underway in the DRC and Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda, and Burundi – the countries most likely to experience spillover infections.

""WHO is deploying Preparedness Support Teams to these and other neighbouring countries, as was done during the previous EVD outbreak in Équateur Province,"" the WHO said. ""These missions aim to assess countries' readiness using a WHO checklist and to provide technical support to countries to develop and implement national contingency plans in collaboration with partners.""

The WHO also said it will be strengthening surveillance capacities in 18 international points of entry in North Kivu. Burundi, Central African Republic, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda and Zambia have already implemented heightened POE activities.

The WHO is not suggesting restricted travel to and from DRC.

False alarm in Uganda

Yesterday, international news media, including Xinhua, reported three suspected cases of Ebola detected in Uganda. Two cases were said to be detected at entry points, and a third was described in a pregnant woman who died from hemorrhage at a hospital. Today officials from the WHO and Uganda took to Twitter to announce that lab testing showed there was no Ebola in Uganda.

""There is no confirmed case of #Ebola in #Uganda as reported in sections of the international media. The MOH have heightened surveillance and operational readiness to respond to #Ebola,"" said Yonas Woldemariam, MD, WHO country representative for Uganda on Twitter.

Aug 14 WHO situation report","Internal conflict is hampering efforts to rein in an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned, urging a ceasefire to stop the virus from spreading.

The death toll from the latest outbreak rose to 41 people by August 1 in DRC's North Kivu province.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief, has called for the rapid roll-out of an unlicensed drug being used for the first time to treat Ebola patients.



Ghebreyesus told reporters on Tuesday he feared conditions on the ground in the eastern province had created ""a conducive environment for the transmission of Ebola.""



The outbreak in North Kivu's Beni region, which shares borders with Uganda and Rwanda, was declared a week after WHO and the Kinshasa government hailed the end of an Ebola flare-up in northwestern Equateur province, which killed 33 people.



The latest outbreak, which now counts 57 probable and confirmed cases, is the country's 10th since 1976, when the disease was first identified in the DRC near the Ebola River.

DRC health authorities said Tuesday that for the first time since the outbreak was announced, one fatality was recorded outside of North Kivu - in the neighbouring province of Ituri.



The new outbreak poses the same problems as past cases in the DRC, including logistical hurdles in a country with weak health infrastructure.

{articleGUID}

But in North Kivu, health workers are being forced to navigate their response among more than 100 armed groups

Ghebreyesus said that there have been 120 violent incidents since January.



He said the region was sprinkled with so-called ""red zones"", or inaccessible areas.



""That environment is really conducive for Ebola ... to transmit freely.

""We call on the warring parties for cessation of hostilities, because the virus is dangerous to all. It doesn't choose between this group or that group,"" he said.



Ebola causes serious illness including vomiting, diarrhoea and in some cases internal and external bleeding. It is often fatal if untreated.

In a bid to halt the virus' advance, DRC health authorities said Tuesday that doctors in Beni had begun using a prototype drug called mAb114 to treat patients.

Developed in the United States, the prototype drug is a protein that binds on to a specific target of the virus and triggers the body's immune system.

In May, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said it was carrying out the first human trials of mAb114 to test it for safety and tolerance.

Ghebreyesus said five patients had received the unlicensed drug so far, and that WHO would like the roll-out ""to speed up as much as possible"".

The outbreak total now stands at 73 cases, of which 46 are confirmed and 27 are probable. Forty-three deaths have been reported, and health officials are investigating 40 suspected cases.

All seven new cases are from Mabalako and involve probable and known contacts of previously confirmed cases.

Yesterday, the MOH confirmed that ring vaccination began in the affected health zone of Ituri province. Earlier this week, Ituri confirmed six cases of Ebola, including one death.

The medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF) announced the opening of an Ebola treatment center on Tuesday in Mangina, the epicenter of the outbreak in North Kivu. A total of 37 patients are currently hospitalized in this facility, with 31 of those cases confirmed and six suspected.

""Among our patients, we have several colleagues from the Congolese health system,"" said Gwenola Seroux, MSF emergency programs coordinator, in a press release. ""They were the first to respond, and some were exposed to the virus.""

CDC: No major measles outbreaks reported this summer

Despite alarming stories from CNN and Fox News, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed there are no far-reaching measles outbreaks this summer.

In recent weeks media outlets have reported that 21 states were involved in a 107-person measles outbreak, as if it was a single, far-reaching outbreak happening across the country.

""We believe this news organization misinterpreted the first paragraph of our Measles Cases and Outbreaks site. Since this article was published, several other outlets have published articles as well and that may be causing some confusion,"" said Kristen Nordlund, a media representative from the CDC, in an interview.

Nordlund explained that each month, CDC updates its Measles Cases and Outbreaks website with the total number of measles cases that have occurred in the United States and the names of states that have reported the cases. To protect patient confidentiality, the CDC does not list the number of cases that occurred in each state.

""The 107 cases reported to CDC have been since January 2018 across 21 states, but they are not one unified outbreak,"" Nordlund said. Last year, a total of 188 cases were confirmed across the United States.

The World Health Organization defines an outbreak of measles as three or more confirmed cases in a population of approximately 100,000 people.

""As always, the best protection against measles is MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccine,"" Nordlund said, also noting that some news organizations, including CNN, have corrected their erroneous reports.

BioNTech and Pfizer sign deal to develop mRNA flu vaccines

BioNTech, a biotechnology company based in Germany, announced today that it has entered a multiyear research collaboration with Pfizer to develop mRNA-based flu vaccines.

According to a statement from BioNTech, the two companies will jointly conduct research and development to advance the vaccines, with Pfizer assuming responsibility for clinical development and commercialization of the mRNA vaccines, following the completion of BioNTech's first human clinical study.

The terms of the deal provide a $120 million initial payment to BioNTech, with the potential for $305 million in additional development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments. It also includes royalty payments if the vaccine is commercialized.

BioNTech's focus has been on targeted immunotherapies for treating cancer and infectious diseases.

Kathryn Jansen, senior vice president and head of Pfizer's vaccine development unit, said in the statement that innovative vaccine approaches are urgently needed to improve protection against flu and respond more quickly and strongly to pandemic threats. ""mRNA vaccines offer a novel approach to code for any protein or multiple proteins, and the potential to manufacture higher potency flu vaccines more rapidly and at a lower cost than contemporary flu vaccines,"" she said.

Aug 16 BioNTech press release",no result found,no result found,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - A mobile blood-testing lab. Hand-washing stations on street corners. Motorcycle taxi drivers forbidden from sharing spare helmets. If Ebola is coming, the city of Goma in eastern Congo wants to be ready.

An outbreak suspected of killing 43 people is spreading across the lush farmlands of eastern Congo, where ethnic and military conflicts threaten to hobble containment efforts.

Goma, a lakeside city of 1 million people near the Rwandan border, is more than 350 km (220 miles) south from the epicenter of the outbreak in the town of Mangina in North Kivu province, and no cases have been confirmed there.

But the virus has already spread to neighboring Ituri province, and the number of infected is rising daily. Residents in the busy trading hub are taking no chances.

“It’s not only me who fears the appearance of Ebola. The whole community here is scared,” said shopkeeper Dany Mupenda. “To protect ourselves we stick to the rules of hygiene to avoid being one of the victims of this epidemic.”

UNICEF has set up handwashing stations around the city, many of whose streets are built on top of the lava rock left from the eruption of the Mount Nyiragongo volcano in 2002.

Health workers check residents’ temperatures in public places and at the entrance to the city. The hospital has set up a mobile lab to test suspected cases.

It is the kind of preparation that has become routine in Congo, which has experienced 10 Ebola outbreaks since the virus was discovered on the Ebola River in 1976, altogether killing some 900 people.

Ebola causes diarrhea, vomiting and hemorrhagic fever and can be spread through bodily fluids. An epidemic between 2013 and 2016 killed more than 11,300 people in West Africa.

Congo, a vast, forested country, has become a staging ground for new treatments, including the first use of vaccines that helped contain an outbreak that was declared over in July, just days before the latest flare-up was discovered.

Goma residents know that medical breakthroughs mean little if simple measures are not taken on the ground. After basketball games, teams have been told not to shake hands, said Fiston Kasongo, a young basketball player.

“What scares me is the speed with which Ebola spreads and the consequences that follow.”

Patrons of Goma’s popular motorcycle taxis have to risk speeding helmetless across town.

“We are told that it can spread through the sweat of heat, and as our helmets are not worn by one customer only, they allowed customers to ride with no helmet to prevent the spread,” said a taximan called Wemba.","The latest Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is shaping up to be the most dangerous and difficult test of the world’s ability to contain the disease since the catastrophic West African outbreak in 2014 and 2015.

Like an outbreak earlier this year, in the western part of the country, cases have been reported across multiple locations, disease transmission is taking place in cities where hundreds of thousands of people live, and there’s the potential for the virus to spread across several international borders.

But this outbreak is occurring in a part of the Congo that has long been a conflict zone, with over 1 million displaced people, scores of armed combatant groups, and “red zones” where outsiders hoping to contain a deadly disease may not be able to travel.

The possibility that the virus could spread unchecked in one of these areas raises prospects of an outbreak that could make this year’s earlier brush with Ebola seem like a training exercise.

“That’s really the worst-case scenario: That we can’t get in quickly enough to an alert [of possible cases] or we just have a blind spot because of security. And then an outbreak really begins to take hold in those blind spots and becomes a multicountry regional outbreak,’’ Dr. Peter Salama, the World Health Organization’s deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response, told STAT.

“That’s what keeps me up at night.”

The outbreak was declared in North Kivu on Aug. 1, a week after the previous epidemic was deemed contained. Genetic analysis of viruses from the two show that while they are caused by the same species of ebolaviruses, Ebola Zaire, they are not linked.

Two weeks into this outbreak, the toll has already surpassed that of the earlier epidemic, which was centered around Bikoro, near DRC’s western border. There were 54 cases and 33 deaths over roughly four months in the Bikoro outbreak. As of Tuesday, there were 73 confirmed and probable cases and 43 deaths in North Kivu, and the case count is rising steadily.

North Kivu is in northeastern Congo, near the border with Uganda and Rwanda. It’s the country’s most populous province, with 8 million people. It is also its most dangerous.

Under a scoring system used by the U.N. to determine the level of risk for its personnel in conflict zones, North Kivu is at level 4. Level 5 means the U.N. must evacuate; it is simply too perilous to be present.

The security concerns mean that the WHO insists responders have armed escorts as they move about — a requirement the medical aid group Doctors Without Borders always refuses on the ground that it undermines the group’s ability to claim neutrality.

The operational strictures they face mean Ebola responders will need to be “very flexible” and “pragmatic,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this week in Geneva.

Already that has led to trimming of ambitions. Whereas in the Bikoro outbreak the WHO hoped to run trials of five experimental Ebola therapies, this time there is no immediate thought of trying to generate data on whether the treatments are effective and which are the most potent.

Dr. David Heymann, a former WHO assistant director-general, and now a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is on an expert committee that advises Salama’s emergency response center.

“The committee recommended that there be no research until outbreak containment was underway — and well underway,” Heymann said Wednesday. Unlicensed drugs can only be used in studies, or in a “compassionate use” setting; the latter will be the approach here.

Likewise, the protocol that would normally be used to determine who should be offered Merck’s experimental Ebola vaccine may have to be modified in some locations. Until the vaccine is fully licensed, the WHO has been advised to use it employing a system known as ring vaccination — find out who has been in contact with a confirmed Ebola case and vaccinate them and all their contacts.

In the current outbreak, vaccination teams may not have the time to conduct the interviews that would be needed to trace all contacts and the contacts of contacts, Salama said.

“If, for example, we find that we can only visit a small village that’s in a red zone area, and it has 200 people, and we can only go once and we’ve only got a couple of hours because of security, then my instruction to the team will be: Go in and vaccine the 200 people because we don’t have the time, security wise, to do detailed contact tracing of that small village,” he said.

Dr. Daniel Bausch is a longtime Ebola responder who is director of the U.K. Public Health Rapid Support Team, a partnership between Public Health England and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Bausch recalled taking part in the response to a Marburg virus outbreak — Marburg is from the same family of viruses as Ebola — in northeastern Congo in the late 1990s, when the WHO had to negotiate with armed groups to operate.

It wasn’t easy, but it was successful, Bausch said, while acknowledging this time will be tougher.

“It’s not the first one that has happened in an area of insecurity, but it’s potentially at least more disseminated an area of insecurity. And a very, very complex area,” Bausch said, pointing to the refugee population. “I do think it is a little bit of uncharted waters.”

Bausch’s team has sent one person to take part in a WHO-led rapid assessment group that is in North Kivu now. From the outset the WHO has said it will have to limit the number of responders it deploys, because of the strain it will place on the U.N. peacekeepers to safeguard their security.

And rather than setting up multiple response outposts, the workers will likely have to cluster in the town of Beni, where they can safely function, using it to make “in and out’’ forays to other, less secure places.

“We don’t want to have people based anywhere to the east, not far to the north, and not beyond 30 kilometers” — roughly 19 miles — “really to the south,” Salama said. “And you’ve got a kind of circle of a 20- to 30-kilometer radius to the west and north which is reasonably secure. And you’ve got very little room to move on the east, in terms of secure zones.”"
17-Aug-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

On 1 August 2018, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the town of Mangina, Mabalako Health Zone, North Kivu Province. Confirmed cases have since between reported from Beni and Mandima health zones, Ituri Province; however, all confirmed exposures and transmission events to date have been linked back to the outbreak epi-centre, Mangina. North Kivu and Ituri are among the most populated provinces in the country, share borders with Uganda and Rwanda, and experience conflict and insecurity, with over one million internally displaced people and migration of refugees to neighbouring countries.

As of 15 August 2018, 78 EVD cases (51 confirmed and 27 probable), including 44 deaths, have been reported.1 Since the DON published on 9 August, 34 new confirmed cases have been reported: seven from Ituri Province (Mandima Health Zone) and 27 from North Kivu Province (one in Beni and 26 in Mabalako health zones). The 78 confirmed or probable cases reside in five health zones in North Kivu and one health zone in Ituri. The majority of cases (39 confirmed and 21 probable) have been reported from Mangina in Mabalako Health Zone (Figure 1). As of 15 August, 24 suspected cases are currently pending laboratory testing to confirm or exclude EVD.

Eight new confirmed cases among health care workers have been reported, bringing the total number of infected health care workers to 10 (nine confirmed and one probable deceased case). These health care workers were likely exposed in clinics, not Ebola treatment centres (ETCs), many of which may have been infected before the declaration of the outbreak. WHO and partners are working to increase awareness of Ebola among health care and other frontline workers, and to strengthen infection prevention and control (IPC) measures.

The MoH, WHO and partners continue to systematically monitor and rapidly investigate all alerts in other provinces and in neighbouring countries. Since the last DON was published, alerts in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as in Uganda, Rwanda, and the Central African Republic were investigated; EVD was ruled out for all.

For more information, see:

Public health response

The MoH rapidly initiated response mechanisms in North Kivu and Ituri provinces with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include the establishment and strengthening of surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC, clinical management, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

During a two-day mission to the outbreak epi-centre, the WHO Director-General (DG), WHO Regional Director (RD) for Africa and WHO Deputy Director-General (DDG), Emergency Preparedness and Response, together with the Minister of Health, observed the launch of Ebola vaccination activities, visited the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), met with partners and staff to discuss the challenges ahead, and assessed response measures and needs.

The WHO DG and the RD then visited Uganda where they were briefed by the WHO Representative on the country’s EVD preparedness. The DG and RD later met the Uganda Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Health, and the Minister of State for Primary Health Care to discuss EVD preparedness and WHO support.

The MoH has activated a multi-partner incident management system and an EOC to coordinate the response, with the main centre in Beni and the field coordination centre in Mangina. WHO has established an incident management team with personnel from the WHO Country Office, Regional Office for Africa and headquarters who are collaborating closely to ensure a comprehensive and effective response to the outbreak.

On 8 August, the MoH, with support from WHO and partners, launched the Ebola ring vaccination activities for high-risk populations. In the first days, health care and other frontline workers were vaccinated. As of 15 August, a total of five rings have been defined around 13 recently confirmed cases. Within these initial rings, more than 500 contacts and their contacts consented and received rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine thus far. Teams are continuing to identify and vaccinate all eligible contacts to help interrupt transmission of the virus.

The MoH and WHO continue to strengthen surveillance in the affected and surrounding areas. As of 15 August, nearly 1600 contacts, including more than 120 health workers, in North Kivu and Ituri provinces have been registered and are being followed up on daily basis.

As of 15 August, WHO has deployed over 100 technical and logistics specialists to support response activities. Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions continue to support the response as well as ongoing readiness and preparedness activities in non-affected provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in bordering countries. For more information about operational readiness and preparedness activities, please see the DON published on 14 August.

In addition to the mobile laboratory established in Beni on 3 August, local testing with Xpert Ebola has since been established in hospital facilities in Beni, Goma, and Mangina to facilitate the timely diagnosis of suspected cases.

The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) have established 60-bed ETCs in Beni and Mangina, respectively. The partners are preparing the ETCs to provide therapeutics under the monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions (MEURI) protocol in collaboration with MoH and Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB). WHO is providing technical expertise support on site and assisting with the creation of a data safety management board.

The MoH team, with support from UNICEF, are training 90 psychosocial agents to provide psychosocial care to patients and other affected people.

Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) surveys were conducted in Beni and Mabalako health zones to assess the levels of EVD awareness in the communities. Findings from the survey will be used to improve the risk communication, social mobilization and community engagement strategy.

Two planes with supplies of cold chain equipment, isolation units and vehicles arrived in Beni on 11 and 12 August.

WHO risk assessment

This latest outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo which border Uganda. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing several epidemics and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri may hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public health risk was assessed to be high at the national and regional levels, and low globally.

WHO advice

The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) working group on Ebola vaccines and the SAGE members have reviewed the epidemiological situation and the evidence available with regard to the different candidate Ebola vaccines and the impact of different interventions. While ring vaccination remains the preferred strategy (as stated in the April 2017 SAGE report, a geographic targeted approach was proposed as an exceptional alternative if the ring vaccination around a laboratory-confirmed case of Ebola proves unfeasible. The following interim recommendation was agreed upon: “Should an Ebola disease outbreak occur before the candidate vaccine is licensed, SAGE recommended that the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine be promptly deployed under the Expanded Access framework, with informed consent and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice. If the outbreak is caused by an Ebola virus species other than Zaire, consideration should be given to the use of other candidate vaccines that target the putative viral species”.

For more information, see:

As investigations continue to establish the full extent of this outbreak and the risk of national and regional spread remains high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure health authorities are alerted and are operationally ready to respond.

WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event.

They bring the outbreak total to 78 cases.

In other outbreak developments, Robert Redfield, MD, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), visited the outbreak area this week, and outbreak responders made more progress with administering vaccine.

Main hot spots are in 3 health zones

The latest confirmed cases all involve people who live near Mangina in the North Kivu province's Mabalako Health Zone, according to a daily update yesterday from the DRC's health ministry. One is in a health worker from Mangina Reference Health Center.

So far 10 Ebola infections have been reported in health workers, 9 confirmed and one listed as probable. The World Health Organization (WHO) said in an update today that the health workers were probably exposed in clinics, not Ebola treatment centers, before the outbreak was declared.

Infections in health workers are known to intensify Ebola outbreaks, and health officials in the DRC have temporarily replaced all health workers in Mangina reference health centers so that all the facility's staff could be isolated and monitored for symptoms. Health officials took similar actions regarding a health center in Beni.

All of the new cases involve probable and known case contacts, the health ministry said. However, global health officials are deeply worried that inaccessible ""red zones"" due to armed conflict might be hiding pockets of Ebola cases.

The outbreak total now stands at 78 cases as of Aug 15, which includes 51 confirmed infections and 27 listed as probable. So far, 44 people have died from Ebola. Health officials are still investigating 24 suspected cases, down from about 40 reported earlier in the week.

So far, the cases are limited to five health zones in North Kivu province, mostly from Mangina in Mabalako health zone, and one health zone in neighboring Ituri province.

Another worry about the outbreak is the high risk of regional spread because of large numbers of displaced people and frequent travel between regions. Earlier this week, health officials said lab tests ruled out a few suspected cases in Uganda. The WHO, which is helping four priority countries step up their preparedness efforts, said Ebola was also ruled out after investigating suspected cases in other DRC provinces, Rwanda, and the Central African Republic, as well.

Vaccination focusing on 5 rings

The DRC's health ministry began vaccination in the outbreak zone on Aug 8, starting with health workers. Contacts of Ebola cases and contacts of contacts are slated to receive doses of VSV-EBOV in a ring vaccination strategy.

The WHO said five rings have been identified surrounding 13 recently confirmed cases, and more than 500 people have been vaccinated so far. It added that teams are still working to identify and immunize all eligible contacts.

The health ministry said vaccination is under way in Mabalako (the area that covers Mangina), Beni, and Mandima (the affected health zone in Ituri province).

CDC officials visit outbreak area

In yesterday's update, the DRC said its health minister, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, PhD, on Aug 15 met with US embassy official Jennifer Haskell, CDC Director Redfield, and the CDC's DRC representative, Raimi Ewetola, MD, DrPH, MPH.

The group discussed cooperation between the health ministry and the CDC, training programs for field epidemiologists, and future options for strengthening collaboration.

The next day, the health ministry took the group to visit the outbreak response area, focusing on Beni, where they toured Beni General Referral Hospital, where a new Ebola treatment center is located.

Aug 17 WHO update

Aug 16 DRC health ministry report","Militia violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is preventing aid workers from accessing potential Ebola victims, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

A total of 78 confirmed and probable cases of the disease have been recorded in northeast DRC since August 1, WHO said on Friday.

The latest outbreak has claimed so far 44 lives (17 confirmed and 27 probable), it added.

At least 1,500 people have been potentially exposed to the deadly virus in North Kivu province but violence in the region means officials cannot be sure if they have identified all the chains by which it is spreading in the east of the vast country.

In the area, health workers are being forced to navigate their response among more than 100 armed groups.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief, said the region was sprinkled with so-called ""red zones"", or inaccessible areas.

""We don't know if we are having all transmission chains identified. We expect to see more cases as a result of earlier infections and these infections developing into illness,"" WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told a news briefing in Geneva.

""The worst-case scenario is that we have these security blindspots where the epidemic could take hold that we don't know about,"" he said.

The outbreak is spreading across the lush farmlands of eastern Congo and has already reached neighbouring Ituri province.

Ebola causes serious illness including vomiting, diarrhoea and in some cases internal and external bleeding. It is often fatal if untreated.

The DRC has experienced 10 Ebola outbreaks since the virus was discovered on the Ebola River in 1976, and it has altogether killed some 900 people.

The United Nations children's agency UNICEF said an unusually high proportion of the people affected in this outbreak were children.

Two children have already died from the disease, and centres in Beni and Mangina were treating six others infected by the disease or suspected to be.

In a bid to halt the virus' advance, DRC health authorities said that doctors in Beni had begun using a prototype drug called mAb114 to treat patients.

Developed in the United States, the prototype drug is a protein that binds on to a specific target of the virus and triggers the body's immune system.

Ghebreyesus said five patients had received the unlicensed drug so far, and that WHO would like the roll-out ""to speed up as much as possible"".

Targeted vaccination, aimed primarily at front-line health workers, began last week, and so far 216 people have received a jab.

An epidemic between 2013 and 2016 killed more than 11,300 people in West Africa.","Ebola outbreak: at least 44 killed in DRCongo

The World Health Organization has warned of more Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo. More than 500 people have been vaccinated so far against the disease, but officials say there are 78 confirmed and probable cases, including 44 deaths.","GENEVA (Reuters) - Militia violence in Democratic Republic of Congo has prevented aid workers from reaching some potential cases in an outbreak of Ebola that has so far killed 47 people, the World Health Organization said on Friday.

Over 2,000 people have been potentially exposed to the virus that began in North Kivu province, but the violence means officials cannot be sure if they have identified all the chains by which it is spreading in the east of the vast country.

“We don’t know if we are having all transmission chains identified. We expect to see more cases as a result of earlier infections and these infections developing into illness,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told a news briefing in Geneva.

“The worst-case scenario is that we have these security blind spots where the epidemic could take hold that we don’t know about,” he said.

Congo’s Health Ministry said confirmed and probable cases numbered 87 in total, including 47 deaths. About 2,150 people have been identified as contacts of people infected with the disease, which causes fever, vomiting and diarrhea.

Health workers “have a huge amount of work to do to follow up on these contacts, to continue the investigations and the active search for cases, as well as to prepare the ground for the vaccination teams,” the ministry said in a statement late on Friday.

The outbreak is spreading across the lush farmlands of eastern Congo. Its epicenter is the town of Mangina in North Kivu province and it has already reached neighboring Ituri province.

Congo has experienced 10 Ebola outbreaks since the virus was discovered on the Ebola River in 1976, altogether killing some 900 people.

An epidemic between 2013 and 2016 killed more than 11,300 people in West Africa.

The United Nations children’s agency UNICEF said an unusually high proportion of the people affected in this outbreak were children.

Two children have already died from the disease, and centers in Beni and Mangina were treating six children infected by the disease or suspected to be.

UNICEF said it had also identified 53 orphaned children who have lost their parents to Ebola.

“The impact of the disease on children is not limited to those who have been infected or suspected,” Gianfranco Rotigliano, the UNICEF representative in Congo, said in a statement.

“Many children are faced with the illness or death of their parents and loved ones, while some children have lost large parts of their families and become isolated. These children urgently need our support”.

The WHO said more than 500 people including health workers have been vaccinated against the disease. It had deployed more than 100 experts to Mangina and Beni towns to oversee tracing, vaccination and safe burials.

There were, however, “red zones” near Mangina that aid workers could not enter for security reasons, Jasarevic said.",no result found

So far 50 deaths have been attributed to hemorrhagic fever during this outbreak, and 12 cases remain under investigation.

In an update yesterday, the DRC ministry of health said one of the newly confirmed cases is in the Mabalako health zone in North Kivu province, and that person is a known and followed probable case contact. A newly confirmed death is also reported in Mabalako, which has 52 of the confirmed cases.

Mabalako, and neighboring Beni, serves as the epicenter of the outbreak. Like other towns in North Kivu, it is also home to rebel violence, a fact that's made controlling this outbreak difficult for the World Health Organization (WHO) and DRC officials.

""To date, surveillance teams have registered 1,609 contacts to follow,"" the DRC said in the translated update. ""Of these contacts to be followed, there are 41 who are in a red zone to which the surveillance teams do not have access because of the security situation.""

The DRC said that, despite the ongoing violence, ring vaccination efforts continue in Mabalako, Beni, and Mandima health zones. Since Aug 8. 873 known contacts have been vaccinated (467 in Mabalako, 256 in Beni, and 150 in Mandima). For the second time this year, the DRC is using Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV, to immunize case contacts and healthcare workers against the virus.

The WHO released a new story detailing care at the Mangina heath center, which is more than 30 kilometers (19 miles) southwest of the city of Beni. Officials suspect the initial case-patient in this outbreak was first seen at the Mangina clinic in late July, where workers suspected she had a particularly bad case of malaria.

The WHO story said at least 75 staff members at the Mangina clinic have had contact with Ebola patients.

Healthcare workers, children infected

In an interview with The Hill, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said at least 10 healthcare workers have been infected during this outbreak. Early infection in healthcare workers is often connected to an increase in Ebola cases, as infected workers may treat a number of patients before realizing they are symptomatic.

Jasarevic also said not all transmission chains have been identified in this outbreak, which could mean ""blind spots"" in the current vaccination strategy.

According to a report from UNICEF on Aug 17, children have also been uniquely affected by the outbreak.

""Two children have already died from the disease. The Ebola treatment centres in Beni and Mangina are currently treating six children that are infected by the disease or suspected to be. UNICEF has identified 53 orphaned children who have lost their parents to Ebola,"" UNICEF said.

Finally, on Aug 17 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its travel warning concerning the DRC, saying travelers should protect themselves against the virus by avoiding contact with other people's blood or body fluids, and paying attention to their health status in the 3 weeks following travel.

According to an update released late yesterday by the DRC's healthy ministry, Ebola cases now total 96 (5 new cases), with 69 confirmed. In addition, 55 people have died. The 5 new cases and 5 newly recorded deaths are all in Mabalako health zone.

Vaccination efforts continue in Mabalako, Beni, and Mangina health zones, the epicenters of the outbreak, and the DRC said a new Ebola treatment center (ETC) will soon open in Ituri province, as the established ETCs in the region are at capacity.

Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson with the World Health Organization (WHO), told CIDRAP News that 13 healthcare workers have tested positive for Ebola, a troubling development, because infected health workers were one of the main factors in the rapid spread of the disease during the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa.

Jasarevic also commented on a recent UNICEF report that said children were being infected at high rates during this outbreak.

""The case distribution is slightly younger than what we might expect when compared to previous outbreaks, but still within the general range; each outbreak is different,"" he said.

Contact tracing in red zones

On Twitter, the WHO confirmed that 10 vaccination rings have been identified around the most recent 28 cases in the outbreak, leading to approximately 1,300 people being vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine.

Earlier this year, the vaccine was used successfully to prevent transmission in a smaller outbreak in western DRC. That outbreak was declared over in late July, after 54 confirmed illnesses, 33 of them fatal.

Although the previous outbreak was challenging because it took place in such a rural area, WHO and DRC officials emphasize the challenge is greater in the current outbreak, which is taking place in an eastern region riddled with as many as 130 rebel fighting groups.

Earlier today, Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, tweeted that 41 case contacts in security ""red zones"" are being followed up daily by health workers from DRC and Doctors Without Borders.

Last week, WHO officials said in a press conference that the ""red zones"" were largely inaccessible to workers trying to complete vaccination chains, and were the most frightening aspect of the outbreak.

Experimental treatment being used on 10 patients

Yesterday Reuters reported that 10 patients in North Kivu are being treated with an experimental monoclonal antibody treatment, mAb114, in Beni.

According to an official from DRC's National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) the 10 patients received the treatment via infusion, and are all showing signs of improvement. The INRB said it is expecting another shipment of mAb114 from the United States later this week.

The DRC also updated information regarding immunization: Since vaccination began on Aug 8, 1,693 people have been vaccinated: 903 in Mabalako, 471 in Beni, and 319 in Mandima health zones.

Four new treatments approved for use

Last week DRC officials begin using the experimental monoclonal antibody treatment mAb114 in Beni on 10 patients. Now, ZMapp, remdesivir, favipiravir, and Regn 3450-3471-3479 are also approved for use in ETCs, the country's health ministry said.

""This Tuesday, August 21, 2018, the Remdesivir, produced by Gilead Sciences, was administered to a patient treated at [ETC] Beni, which is doing well. As a reminder, the mAb114 began to be used since Saturday, August 11, 2018. It was administered to 10 patients who are experiencing a positive evolution.""

In its latest weekly outbreak bulletin, the World Health Organization's (WHO's) regional office of Africa shared new details of the response measures being taken in North Kivu.

The WHO said that, as of Aug 18, only 59% of contacts had been successfully followed up on, but contacts in Mandima health zone were not followed up for ""an apparent community resistance.""

That resistance comes in a region divided among 130 rebel groups. The area is also home to more than 1 million refugees, making it one of the DRC's most dangerous places.

""The coming days are going to be critical in the evolution of the outbreak as the people who were earlier exposed to infections continue to develop the disease,"" the WHO said. ""It is also a defining moment in the race to contain the outbreak, during which new exposures to infections should be averted, disrupting further transmission.

""This can only be achieved through meticulous field work to identify every single contact and transmission chain. There is an urgent need to continue scaling up and improve effectiveness and efficiency of all aspects of the response.""

Role of population boom

Today the New England Journal of Medicine published a commentary on recent Ebola outbreaks, highlighting the connection between Central Africa's population boom and an increased risk of the disease.

Before 2013, the authors write, Ebola outbreaks were usually confined to small rural clusters of cases that had limited ability to spread over large geographic areas.

But as the population booms and roads expand across the continent to accommodate a growing economic infrastructure, the region is at a greater risk for disease spread that must be combatted with preventative public health spending, write the authors, led by Vincent J. Munster, PhD. Munster serves as the chief of the virus ecology unit at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

""Rather than spending exorbitant amounts reactively for control operations, international donors could invest in long-term public health and prevention infrastructure,"" they write. Part of that investment, they say, should come in the form of human capital—more rural health workers trained to identify Ebola, and more African scientists to strengthen research infrastructure.

Health authorities last week started administering the U.S.-developed mAb114 treatment to Ebola patients, the first time such a treatment had been used against an active outbreak.

The health ministry said in a daily bulletin late on Tuesday that the 10 patients who received mAb114 since Aug. 11 have experienced a “positive evolution,” but the outbreak has continued to grow.

The four additional treatments approved by Congo’s ethics committee are Remdesivir, made by U.S.-based Gilead Sciences; ZMapp, an intravenous treatment made by San Diego’s Mapp Pharmaceutical; Japanese drug Favipiravir; and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ Regn3450 – 3471 – 3479.

Remdesivir was administered to its first patient in the town of Beni on Tuesday, who is doing well, the ministry said in its bulletin.

The ministry said on Wednesday that one new case and two new deaths had been confirmed from the hemorrhagic fever, which causes vomiting and severe diarrhea, bringing the total number of deaths to 61 and confirmed cases to 76 since last month.

Congo, whose heavily forested interior makes its a natural home for Ebola, is at the forefront of a global campaign to combat the virus, which killed more than 11,000 people when it swept through West Africa from 2013-2016.

The Central African country has experienced ten Ebola outbreaks since the virus was discovered in northern Congo in 1976 - more than twice as many as any other country - and 33 people died in a flare-up in the northwest that ended last month.

In addition, a vaccine manufactured by Merck, which proved effective against the earlier outbreak in northwestern Congo, has been administered to 2,179 health workers and contacts of Ebola patients.

In a statement after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, government spokesman Lambert Mende said that about 5,000 doses of the vaccine remained available.

Insecurity in Congo’s eastern borderlands with Uganda has continued to complicate the response, with some contacts of Ebola patients located in so-called “red-zones”, which are off limits to emergency responders due to militia activity.

Instead, local health workers in those areas are monitoring the contacts and no Ebola cases have yet been confirmed there.",no result found

In a graph showing the percentage of case contacts traced, Salama explained, ""Dips in recent days show when work was needed to engage with communities before teams could access some areas. That work was done successfully. On 20 August, 95% of 1,782 contacts followed-up in 3 health zones.""

The information comes from the WHO's third situation report on the outbreak, published yesterday. According to the WHO and the DRC, Ebola cases increased by just 1 yesterday, to 103, with 76 confirmed. The death toll rose by 2, to 61, and 7 cases are suspected.

The new case involved a healthcare worker from Mabalako health zone, the epicenter of the outbreak. There have been 14 healthcare workers infected during this outbreak.

More vaccine by end of week

The DRC also confirmed the vaccination of 2,179 people, and said yesterday that officials began vaccinating the first confirmed transmission chain in Oicha. An additional 2,160 doses of Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine will be shipped to the region by the end of the week, after 7,160 doses arrived in Kinshasa on Aug 20.

Representatives from the European Union and the United Nations visited the outbreak area yesterday and met the medical teams leading the response efforts, the DRC health ministry said.

The WHO said a total of 10 case-patients have recovered from the disease so far and have returned home. As of Aug 20, 39 patients are being treated in Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) in Mabalako and Beni. Also, as of Aug 20, 637 of the 2,408 known case contacts completed the 21-day mandatory follow-up period.

The report also contains new epidemiologic information: The median age of patients is 32 years (age range, 0 to 74), and those 30 to 39 years old are the most affected, accounting for 28% of the cases. Women make up 58% of all cases.

Other response efforts

The epicenter of the outbreak remains Mabalako in North Kivu, where approximately 80% of cases have been reported, but the WHO reported that a new ETC is being built in the Makeke health area in Ituri province.

""North Kivu and Ituri are among the most populated provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. North Kivu shares borders with Uganda and Rwanda,"" the WHO said. ""The provinces have been experiencing intense insecurity and a worsening humanitarian crisis, with over one million internally displaced people and a continuous efflux of refugees to neighbouring countries, including Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania.""

The WHO said that, as of Aug 19, it had deployed 119 experts to address the outbreak, 113 of them based in Beni and Mangina, which are both in Mabalako.

Aug 22 DRC health ministry update",no result found,no result found,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo has approved four more experimental treatments against the deadly Ebola virus, the health ministry said as it raced to contain an outbreak in its violence-torn east.

Health authorities last week started administering the U.S.-developed mAb114 treatment to Ebola patients, the first time such a treatment had been used against an active outbreak.

The health ministry said in a daily bulletin late on Tuesday that the 10 patients who received mAb114 since Aug. 11 have experienced a “positive evolution”, but the outbreak has continued to grow.

The four additional treatments approved by Congo’s ethics committee are Remdesivir, made by Israel’s Gilead Sciences; ZMapp, an intravenous treatment made by San Diego’s Mapp Pharmaceutical; Japanese drug Favipiravir; and one referred to as Regn3450 – 3471 – 3479.

Remdesivir was administered to its first patient in the town of Beni on Tuesday, who is doing well, the ministry said in its bulletin.

Six new cases and four new deaths have been confirmed from the haemmorhagic fever, which causes vomiting and severe diarrhea, the ministry said.

That brings the total number of deaths to 59 and confirmed cases to 75 since last month.

24-Aug-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

Since the last Disease Outbreak News on 17 August 2018, 25 additional cases have been laboratory confirmed for Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These new confirmed cases have been reported in Beni, Oicha and Mabalako health zones (North Kivu province) and Mandima health zone (Ituri Province). However, all exposures and transmission events, to date, have been linked back to the outbreak epi-centre, Mabalako. Beyond the EVD outbreak, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is in a complex humanitarian crisis and is experiencing several other concurrent epidemics.

As of 22 August 2018, a total of 103 EVD cases (76 confirmed and 27 probable) including 63 deaths (36 confirmed and 27 probable) have been reported1 in five health zones in North Kivu (Beni, Butembo, Oicha, Mabalako, Musienene) and one health zone in Ituri (Mandima) (Figure 1). The majority of cases (62 confirmed and 21 probable) have been reported from Mabalako in Mabalako Health Zone (Figure 2). As of 22 August, six new suspected cases from Mabalako (n=3) and Beni (n=3) are pending laboratory testing to confirm or exclude EVD. A total of 88 confirmed and probable cases have age and sex reported. As of 19 August, the median age was 32 years (age range: 0-74), with the age group 30-39 accounting for 28% (25/88) of cases. Fifty eight percent (51/88) of all cases were female (Figure 3).

Fourteen cases have been reported among health workers, of which 13 were laboratory confirmed; one has died. Many of these health care workers were likely infected in clinics before the declaration of the outbreak, not in Ebola treatment centres (ETCs). WHO and partners are working with health workers and communities to increase awareness on infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures, as well as vaccinate those at risk of infection.

The MoH, WHO and partners continue to systematically monitor and rapidly investigate all alerts in all provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in neighbouring countries2. Alerts in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as in Uganda, Rwanda, and the Central African Republic have been investigated; EVD has been ruled out in all alert events to date.

For more information, see:

Figure 3: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by age and sex, 19 August 2018 (n=88)

Public health response

The MoH has rapidly initiated response mechanisms in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include the establishment and strengthening of surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC, clinical management, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

The Prime Minister and the MoH of the Democratic Republic of the Congo visited various points of entry (PoEs) in Goma where health measures to screen travellers are being implemented.

On 20 August, 7160 additional doses of vaccines arrived in Kinshasa and were promptly transported to Beni. An additional 2160 doses of vaccine will be shipped before the end of the week.

As of 20 August, contact tracing activities have resumed in Mandima health zone following the engagement of communities by the national and local authorities. A network of partners has been set up to develop geographic information and interactive visualization tools to allow real-time monitoring of the evolution of the situation and the response.

As of 19 August, WHO has deployed over 100 technical and logistics specialists to support response activities. Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions continue to support the response as well as ongoing readiness and preparedness activities in non-affected provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in neighbouring countries.

The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) have established Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) in Beni and Mangina. ETCs have been prepared to provide therapeutics under the monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions (MEURI) protocol in collaboration with the MoH and the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB). WHO is providing technical expertise on site and is assisting with the creation of a data safety management board. To date, 13 patients have received investigational therapeutics.

A medical evacuation (medevac) support team from Norway arrived in Goma to provide specialized training on medevac procedures and handling of equipment using already existing facilities donated by Norway.

Efforts to improve communication and engagement between responders and community members are being prioritized, especially in relation to patient care and loss of lives as a result of EVD. Additionally, outreach and sensitization activities with community influencers and networks will continue in affected areas.

The WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) has facilitated the deployment of nine experts and is in the process of deploying an additional 15 experts to 10 countries including the Democratic Republic of the Congo for EVD preparedness activities.

GOARN and AFRO regional partners are implementing preparedness and readiness missions in at-risk countries neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Multi-disciplinary teams composed of staff from WHO and other operational partners have been deployed in Rwanda and Burundi.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is supporting the Congolese Red Cross to conduct safe and dignified burial (SBD). As of 23 August 2018, six SDB teams are operational in Beni, Mangina and Butembo. Two additional teams will complete their training this week and will be operational. As of 21 August, 47 SDBs have been successful conducted.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM), WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are supporting the National Border Health Programme of the MoH to map and equip critical points of entry to help detect and prevent the spread of the disease to other provinces and internationally.

As of 20 August 2018, Points of Entry (POE) surveillance (health screening) activities, along with risk communication and hygiene promotion, are in place at 21 sites in Beni and in Goma.

The WHO preparedness team in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in collaboration with the MoH and partners, have identified 14 provinces (priority 1: Sud Kivu, Ituri, Maniema, Tshopo; priority 2: Haut-Uele, Mongala, Nord-Ubangi, Sud-Ubangi; priority 3: Sankuru, Kasai, Kasai Central, Kasai Oriental, Bandundu, Lomani) to enhance their preparedness and readiness capacities.

WHO risk assessment

This latest outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo which border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing several epidemics and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri may hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public health risk was assessed to be high at the national and regional levels, and low globally.

WHO advice

The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) working group on Ebola vaccines has reviewed the epidemiological situation and the evidence available with regard to the different candidate Ebola vaccines and the impact of different interventions. While ring vaccination remains the preferred strategy (as stated in the April 2017 SAGE report), a geographic targeted approach was proposed as an exceptional alternative if the ring vaccination around a laboratory-confirmed case of Ebola proves unfeasible. The following interim recommendation was agreed upon: “Should an Ebola disease outbreak occur before the candidate vaccine is licensed, SAGE recommended that the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine be promptly deployed under the Expanded Access framework, with informed consent and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice. If the outbreak is caused by an Ebola virus species other than Zaire, consideration should be given to the use of other candidate vaccines that target the putative viral species”3.

For more information, see:

As investigations continue to establish the full extent of this outbreak and the risk of national and regional spread remains high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure health authorities are alerted and are operationally ready to respond.

WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented any travel restriction to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers to DRC should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

According to the DRC's ministry of health yesterday, Ebola case counts held steady from the previous day, at 103 (76 confirmed). Two more people have perished from the virus, bringing the death toll to 63, and the number of suspected cases has jumped to 13.

Early today Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said in a telebriefing that the outbreak, which began on Aug 1 in North Kivu province, is in one of the most dangerous places in the DRC. He explained that North Kivu is a United Nations (UN) security area ""stage 4""; stage 5 requires UN evacuation.

""More than 80% of cases are in and around Mangina. If we look within 20 to 30 kilometer radius we see the overwhelming majority of cases occurring there,"" Salama said. ""We know that radius contains an accessible population.""

This is the tenth outbreak in DRC since 1976, and the current outbreak is now in six distinct locations along the country's eastern border.

Cases in Oicha prove challenging

Salama said the case involving the physician was confirmed earlier this week in Oicha, a town 30 kilometers east of Beni, adding that there are as many as two more suspected cases in that town. The index case was likely a physician who traveled to Oicha from Beni and may have infected his wife, Salama said.

The road to Oicha is in a red zone. According to Reuters, Oicha is almost entirely surrounded by ADF Ugandan Islamist militia.

""This is the problem we were anticipating and dreading,"" Salama said. He said a health team has reached Oicha with armed experts.

So far, a total of 14 healthcare workers have been infected during this outbreak, 1 of them fatally.

About 500 healthcare workers have been vaccinated against Ebola, as have 600 children, Salama said. A total of f 2,613 people have now been vaccinated in 21 rings around the 40 most recently confirmed cases.

Salama also provided more details on the use of therapeutics in this outbreak. Thirteen patients have been given the experimental monoclonal antibody treatment mAb114, with positive results, and one patient has been started on remdesivir. More patients are expected to be given remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug, in the next 2 days.

Finally, Salama recounted the details of angry youths who burned down a health center in the village of Manbangu after they learned of a local death from Ebola. He said community outreach has been strengthened in that village and vaccinations have resumed.

Aug 23 DRC update

Aug 24 Reuters story","A doctor in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been hospitalised with the deadly Ebola virus after coming into contact with nearly 100 people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday investigating the infection and its possible spread to 97 people in contact with the physician would be difficult because the area was entirely surrounded by rebels.

Since the outbreak erupted in DRC on August 1, 103 confirmed and probable cases of Ebola have been identified in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, including 63 deaths, the health ministry said.

""It is the first time we have a confirmed case and contacts in an area of high insecurity,"" said Dr Peter Salama, WHO's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response.

""It is really the problem we were anticipating and at same time dreading,"" he told a news briefing.

Salama said the Ebola infection occurred in the eastern town of Oicha, 50km from DRC's border with Uganda.

'Pivotal moment'

The area was surrounded by fighters from the Allied Democratic Forces, who he said posed ""extremely serious security concerns"".

WHO and health experts reached Oicha with an armed escort by MONUSCO troops this week, Salama said.

The DRC's military launched an offensive against the armed group in January after an attack on Tanzanian UN peacekeepers that killed 15 soldiers.

""We are at quite a pivotal moment in this outbreak in terms of the evolution of the outbreak epidemiologically and in terms of the response,"" said Salama.

A total of 105 confirmed and probable cases of the disease have been reported since the flare-up began on August 1 in Mangina in North Kivu province, according to the country's health ministry.

Of them, 77 have been confirmed by laboratory tests. There are another 28 probable cases in which biological samples are not available for laboratory testing.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported, as of August 23, a total of 67 deaths, with 39 confirmed as Ebola and 28 listed as probable.

Of the confirmed cases, 11 people have recovered from the potentially deadly virus, while 27 others are hospitalised.

Health minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga travelled to Mangina on Thursday and saw two patients being discharged after they were treated with a new prototype treatment called mAb114.



""These two people are among the first 10 patients to have received the therapeutic molecule mAb114,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Congratulations to these survivors, and also to @MinSanteRDC for making investigational #Ebola treatments available at scale during an outbreak. A global first, and a ray of hope for people with the disease. We are your proud partners. https://t.co/n3kwQYLuqm — Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) August 25, 2018

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of WHO, on Saturday congratulated the DRC's government for making several experimental treatments available in this Ebola outbreak, calling it ""a global first, and a ray of hope for people with the disease"".

Developed in the United States, the mAb114 is the first therapeutic drug to be used in an active Ebola epidemic in the DRC.

The drug consists of a protein that binds on to a specific target of the virus and triggers the body's immune system.



Earlier this week, the health ministry said four other experimental drugs had been approved for treating infected patients.



On Friday, the WHO warned that signs that the virus had spread to the city of Oicha in North Kivu province could frustrate efforts to contain the virus.



While Oicha itself is not under rebel control, Peter Salama, the WHO's emergency response chief, said the city is entirely surrounded by territory held by a Ugandan armed group known as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).



Large numbers of civilians have been killed by unrest around Oicha, while aid workers, priests and government employers are currently being held hostage there by fighters.

In other outbreak developments, outbreak coordinators held a public meeting in Beni to ease tensions following recent community protests against the response, and health teams closed and disinfected a clinic in Beni that recently reported three cases. Another health ministry report said two patients who were given the experimental treatment mAb114 have recovered from their infections.

Also, a group of experts wrote in a Stat commentary that pregnant and lactating women should be included in vaccination efforts.

Total includes 83 confirmed cases

The newly confirmed cases are from Mabalako, the health zone that includes the hot spot city of Mangina, as well as Beni and Oicha, where an illness was confirmed in a physician last week and where at least two more suspected cases were reported.

The new developments push the overall outbreak total to 111 cases, including 83 confirmed and 28 probable cases. Nine more deaths were reported, raising that total to 72. Health officials are investigating 10 suspected cases, according to the ministry's update today.

The World Health Organization (WHO) in an Aug 24 update provided some epidemiologic details about the patients sickened in the outbreak so far.

Of 88 confirmed and probable cases reported as of Aug 19, the median age is 32 years old, with an age range of 0 to 74 years. Adults ages 30 to 39 account for 28% (25) of the cases. Of all cases, 58% (51) are female. Earlier in the outbreak, WHO officials had said responders were seeing a higher-than-expected number of illnesses in women and children.

Illness onsets range from late April to Aug 13, according to the WHO.

Community meeting to ease tensions

The meeting in Beni included the mayor, community leaders, customary chiefs, cell leaders, youth movements, and civil society, the health ministry said today in its update. More than 350 people met with outbreak response coordinators for more than 4 hours asking questions and raising concerns.

""This exchange helped to ease tensions within the community,"" the ministry said, adding that at the end of the meeting authorities agreed to prepare an action plan to support the response, including signaling of alerts.

Last week, media outlets reported that angry youth burned a health center in the village of Manbangu where Ebola vaccine was given. A health ministry spokeswoman told Reuters that an incident took place at the clinic, but that it hadn't been burned.

Beni clinic shuttered after illnesses

The DRC's health ministry said health teams have closed and disinfected a clinic in Beni after it reported three Ebola cases, two confirmed and one probable, according to its Aug 25 update. It said the steps are geared toward curbing transmission to other people and health workers.

Several health workers have been infected in the outbreak in Mangina and Beni, many of whom were thought to have been exposed to sick patients before the outbreak was declared.

Health workers are known to amplify the spread of the disease, and outbreak response teams have removed staff from at least two facilities so that potentially exposed health workers can be quarantined and monitored for any symptoms.

Two recoveries after mAb114 treatment

Earlier this month, health teams started using an antibody treatment called mAb114 in treatment centers in Beni and Mangina, marking the first time an experimental therapy has been used in an active Ebola outbreak in the DRC.

Two of the first 10 patient to receive mAb114 have recovered from their Ebola infections, the health ministry said in its Aug 24 update.

""The short, medium and long-term observations of patients and survivors will make it possible to evaluate the extent to which the molecule has contributed to their recovery,"" it said.

mAb114 is based on antibodies of a patient who survived Ebola in the DRC city of Kikwit in 1995 and is one of five treatments approved for compassionate use in the DRC's current outbreak.

Regarding vaccination, the number of people immunized with VSV-EBOV has risen to 4,130, the health ministry said in its update yesterday. The total includes 1,822 in Mabalako, 761 in Beni, 887 in Mandima, and 121 in Oicha.

In its recent update, the WHO said 7,160 more vaccine doses arrived in Kinshasa on Aug 20 and were immediately sent to Beni. It added that it expected that an additional 2,160 doses would be shipped by the end of the week.

Push for vaccinating pregnant women

In a commentary in Stat today, three US health experts wrote that the decision by outbreak responders not to immunize pregnant and lactating women with the experimental Ebola vaccine unfairly deprives them of protection against the deadly disease.

The authors are Ruth Faden, PhD, MPH, founder of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, Ruth Karron, MD, director the Center for Immunization Research and the Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative, and Carleigh Krubiner, PhD, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. All are part of the Pregnancy Research Ethics for Vaccines, Epidemics, and New Technologies (PREVENT) international working group.

Though the scientists acknowledged that information about the safety of the experimental vaccine in pregnancy is limited, they wrote that the knowledge gap is dwarfed by what's known from previous outbreak about the impact of the disease on pregnant women. They said up to 90% of pregnant women infected with Ebola have died from the disease, and nearly 100% of pregnancies in Ebola-infected women resulted in miscarriage or neonatal death.

The trio also contended that pregnant and lactating women are more likely than others to care for sick relatives, putting them in harm's way.

Though the VSV-EBOV vaccine has shown benefits in efficacy trials, its use in pregnant women outside of an outbreak setting wouldn't be seen as appropriate, they said. ""But during a high-incidence Ebola outbreak, the catastrophic maternal and fetal mortality rates change the calculus, with the potential benefits of offering the vaccine to pregnant contacts clearly outweighing the potential harms,"" they wrote.

The group also noted that at least 20 pregnant women were unintentionally vaccinated in a previous trial, with no evidence of harm. They urged health leaders to apply the recent WHO rationale for using yellow fever vaccine—which also contains live vaccine virus—for pregnant women.

Aug 27 Stat commentary

Related Aug 27 Stat story",no result found,no result found,no result found,"Days after the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared an end to a deadly Ebola outbreak in the western province of Équateur, a new one emerged in North Kivu province. With the number of cases and death toll rising rapidly, the country’s ministry of health, the World Health Organization, and partners are working to launch a rapid and effective response that includes the use of an experimental vaccine. But their decision not to vaccinate women who are pregnant or lactating unfairly deprives them of the protection they deserve against this deadly disease.

The latest outbreak is due to the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus, a highly lethal variant that was responsible for more than 11,000 deaths in the 2013-2016 epidemic in West Africa and which killed 60 percent of those infected in the recent initial DRC outbreak. The new Ebola eruption has the potential to be even more lethal, as the North Kivu Province is the site of an ongoing armed conflict that makes medical treatment far more difficult to provide.

Fortunately, an experimental vaccine called rVSV-ZEBOV has been shown to be highly effective against this strain of Ebola virus. The DRC’s ministry of health, along with WHO and partners, has already begun employing the vaccine using the highly successful ring vaccination strategy, in which contacts and contacts-of-contacts of people with Ebola are offered the vaccine to halt the spread of the disease.

advertisement

Some contacts, though, won’t get the vaccine. Pregnant women and those who are lactating are being excluded from this life-saving intervention. From a public health perspective and an ethical perspective, the decision to exclude pregnant and lactating women is utterly indefensible.

There’s no question that evidence about the safety of the Ebola vaccine in pregnancy is limited. But what we don’t know is dwarfed by what we do know. We know that in previous outbreaks, up to 90 percent of pregnant women infected with Ebola died from it. We know that nearly 100 percent of the pregnancies of Ebola-infected women end in miscarriage or neonatal death. And we also know that pregnant and lactating women are more likely than many others in the population to be caring for sick relatives, and thus are among those most likely to be infected. Indeed, the most recent WHO situation report on Ebola in the DRC shows that a large proportion of the cases are among women of childbearing potential.

The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is currently the only Ebola vaccine that has successfully completed efficacy trials and is being used in response efforts. This vaccine would not likely be viewed as appropriate for use in pregnant women outside the context of an Ebola outbreak. But during a high-incidence Ebola outbreak, the catastrophic maternal and fetal mortality rates change the calculus, with the potential benefits of offering the vaccine to pregnant contacts clearly outweighing the potential harms.

This favorable benefit-risk assessment is bolstered by the fact that in a previous trial, at least 20 women unintentionally received the Ebola vaccine while pregnant, with no evidence of harm.

rVSV-ZEBOV is a live vaccine, and live vaccines are not routinely given during pregnancy. Yet WHO recommendations regarding the use of a live yellow fever vaccine provide an important example of what could and should be done now with a live vaccine for Ebola. In its consideration of the benefits and risks of administering yellow fever vaccine to pregnant and lactating women at high risk of infection, WHO guidance states: “In [yellow fever] endemic areas, or during outbreaks, the benefits of [yellow fever] vaccination are likely to far outweigh the risk of potential transmission of vaccine virus to the fetus or infant.”

The same thinking should apply to Ebola. The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine will give pregnant women, and the children they are carrying, a chance to live. Without it, most of the pregnant women infected with Ebola, and almost all of their infants, will die.

Current considerations related to the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine and pregnant women highlight additional issues related to the equitable inclusion of the interests of pregnant women and their offspring in development and deployment of vaccines for emerging epidemic threats. For example, failure to routinely include pregnancy status in infectious disease surveillance systems means that accurate epidemiologic risk data are often unavailable. And failure to appropriately include pregnant women in vaccine research means that evidence about safety and effectiveness of vaccines in pregnancy has been limited and late in coming. As a result, pregnant women continue to be denied opportunities to receive vaccines that would protect them and their offspring during outbreaks and epidemics.

The Pregnancy Research Ethics for Vaccines, Epidemics, and New Technologies (PREVENT) Working Group, of which we are members, has brought together an international team of experts in bioethics, maternal immunization, maternal-fetal medicine, obstetrics, pediatrics, philosophy, public health, and vaccine research to provide specific recommendations developed to address this critical gap in vaccine research and development and epidemic response. This group recognizes that excluding pregnant women from efforts to develop and deploy vaccines against emerging threats is not acceptable. Business as usual can no longer continue.

The PREVENT team is creating a road map for the ethically responsible, socially just, and respectful inclusion of the interests of pregnant women in the development and deployment of vaccines against emerging pathogens. But pregnant and lactating women in North Kivu province can’t wait for our recommendations to be released and implemented. Continued exclusion of pregnant and lactating women from the Ebola vaccine response would be profoundly unfair — and profoundly unwise.

The DRC ministry of health and the WHO must recognize that women who are pregnant or lactating and who are contacts of Ebola patients must be given equal treatment. They are as entitled as any other contacts to the lifesaving benefits of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine.

The exclusion of pregnant and lactating women from an effort to vaccinate people exposed to the Ebola virus in the current outbreak is wrong, indefensible, and should be reversed, three public health experts wrote Monday in an opinion article published in STAT.

The Johns Hopkins University experts argued it is unfair to deny pregnant and lactating women the experimental vaccine if they wish to take it, given the great risk Ebola poses to them. The fatality rate is 80 percent or higher for pregnant women who contract Ebola, and nearly all survivors miscarry.

The decision was made by the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s health ministry, based on the advice of two expert panels that advise it on use of experimental Ebola therapies and vaccines. But the DRC’s position echoes the recommendations of the World Health Organization on how to use Merck’s still-unlicensed Ebola vaccine.

“The … vaccine will give pregnant women, and the children they are carrying, a chance to live. Without it, most of the pregnant women infected with Ebola, and almost all of their infants, will die,” wrote Ruth Faden, Ruth Karron, and Carleigh Krubiner in their commentary.

The current outbreak in northeastern DRC is of grave concern to the WHO and other agencies mounting a response, set as it is in a part of the country engulfed in a long-running conflict. More than 100 armed groups operate in the area, and traveling among affected communities requires military escort.

A total of 111 cases have been recorded since the outbreak was declared on Aug. 1, and 72 of those people have died.

A ring vaccination program has been mounted to try to halt spread of the virus. In this program — like the one undertaken in another outbreak in the country earlier this year — the Merck vaccine is being offered to contacts of known cases and the contacts of contacts. Anyone over the age of 1 can be vaccinated. Anyone, that is, except pregnant and lactating women.

The exclusion is based on safety concerns due to the fact that the vaccine is made with live viruses. It’s not Ebola, but rather a livestock virus called vesicular stomatitis virus that doesn’t cause disease in people. The VSV virus has been modified to contain a protein from Ebola viruses that teaches the immune system to recognize and fight Ebola.

Those vaccine viruses cannot infect a recipient with the deadly disease. But live virus vaccines are typically more reactogenic, meaning they are more likely than killed-virus vaccines to make a recipient feel achy, or run a fever, or experience soreness at the injection site. There is also at least theoretical concern that the viruses in the vaccine could pass through the placenta to the fetus, Karron told STAT in a joint interview with her co-authors, but she added there is little evidence that live virus vaccines are harmful in pregnancy.

Still, in general there is wariness about giving pregnant and lactating women any drug or vaccine that hasn’t been tested in this population. But researchers and companies are also leery about testing drugs or vaccines in pregnant and lactating women — and women in this demographic were excluded from the clinical trials that studied the Merck vaccine.

There is a vicious cycle at play here, said Faden, former director of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics.

“People will say, ‘Well, where’s the evidence this vaccine is safe in pregnancy?’ Well, how can we know if we’ve never tested it in pregnancy? ‘Well, we couldn’t test it in pregnancy because it’s not safe to test it in pregnancy,’” she said. “And if you can’t get off that … little spinning wheel, pregnant women and their babies are going to be left out indefinitely.”

The three experts — Karron is a pediatrician and professor at Hopkins’s public health school, and Krubiner is a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C. — are part of a project called PREVENT. The acronym stands for Pregnancy Research Ethics for Vaccines, Epidemics, and New Technologies.

They wrote the commentary on their own, but say their position on the unfairness of the current Ebola vaccination policy is shared by the other members of the group.

The PREVENT initiative stems from work to advocate for more research in women. For years, drugs in development were mostly tested in men, a practice that failed to recognize that women are biologically different and that results found in men might not extrapolate faithfully to women.

While progress has been made on that front, Faden said, pregnant women are still largely absent from clinical trials, resulting in a paucity of information about whether new drugs and vaccines are safe for them. The goal may be to protect these women and the fetuses they carry, but that impulse to protect harms them as a consequence, she and her colleagues argued.

Karron noted that women are more likely to be caregivers, meaning if there is Ebola in a community, they may be at greatest risk of contracting it. And in some countries where Ebola is transmitted, women have more children, spending many years either pregnant or breastfeeding.

According to the CIA World Factbook, the mean age at which women have their first child in DRC is just under 20 years old and, on average, women have 4.4 children each. In the United States, the comparable figures are 26.4 years old and 1.9 children apiece.

“It further disadvantages a much larger population,” Karron said of the policy not to offer this vaccine to pregnant and lactating women.

A Belgian gynecologist who works with Doctors without Borders supported the call to change the policy. Dr. Séverine Caluwaerts volunteered with MSF — the group is known by the acronym for its name in French — during the West Africa outbreak of 2014 through 2016.

After it ended, Caluwaerts published a heartrending account of a seven-months-pregnant woman who was brought to an Ebola treatment center in Forécariah province, Guinea. The woman, 25, was a known contact of a case, but had been denied access to the ring vaccination trial because she was pregnant.

Severely ill when she entered the treatment center, the woman went into early labor, giving birth to a little girl named Nubia who, miraculously, survived. The mother died.

(Caluwaerts said the child is now 2 1/2 years old; her former caregivers follow her progress, thinking of her as “a miracle child.”)

“We absolutely don’t agree with the decision of WHO and the Congolese government not to administer the vaccine to pregnant women,” Caluwaerts said. “We would at least give them the choice.”

“The risk-benefit is so much in favor of giving the vaccine.’’

The final decision on whom to vaccinate rests with the DRC government, not the WHO, said Dr. Peter Salama, the global health agency’s deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response.

“I’m not trying to absolve WHO of responsibility here,” Salama said on Friday. “But ultimately it is up to the country’s research and ethical review bodies to weigh up what is simply not a black-and-white decision.”

But those expert panels were likely guided in their deliberations by the WHO’s recommendation against using the vaccine in pregnant and lactating women.

Interestingly, until recently the WHO also recommended against giving the vaccine to children under the age of 6, because of a lack of data to show it is safe and effective in children younger than 6. But that guidance was amended to include children ages 1 and older, if they are contacts of Ebola cases, or contacts of contacts. That is the approach that was used in the earlier Ebola outbreak in western DRC.

Salama conceded that decision was made without evidence to guide it. “It’s a good point. We don’t have a lot of data for the 1- to 6-year-old group. But we do have for slightly older children some data at least,” he said.

The agency also has a little data on the safety of the vaccine in pregnant women, though it has never published what it knows in the scientific literature. In the initial ring vaccination trial that showed the Merck vaccine is protective, roughly 20 pregnant women were inadvertently vaccinated. That can happen in clinical trials because in the early weeks of pregnancy, women often are not aware of their status.

In fact, the evidence gained from inadvertent vaccinations is likely why the WHO advises that in yellow fever outbreaks, pregnant women should be vaccinated — even though the yellow fever vaccine is made with live viruses. The vaccine has been in use for decades.

Faden and her colleagues argue it makes no sense to recommend use of the yellow fever vaccine in pregnant women, but withhold vaccine to protect against Ebola, a more deadly pathogen. Salama, though, said the analogy is not a good one; the yellow fever vaccines in use have been licensed.

“These [Ebola vaccines] are investigational products of which we have very limited data even to use in non-pregnant populations,” Salama said.

Caluwaerts’s report on Nubia’s mother mentioned the women who had been inadvertently vaccinated with the Ebola vaccine. It may be their only reference in the scientific literature. She’d learned about the data from the lead author of the initial ring vaccination trial, the WHO’s Ana Maria Henao-Restrepo.

“She hasn’t published her data yet on the 20 women who were accidentally vaccinated,” said Caluwaerts. “She just said orally at a conference that they are fine and that the babies are fine, but we haven’t seen it in writing. MSF would love to be able to see this in writing, also to be able to advocate more for the vaccine for pregnant women.’’

STAT reached out to Henao-Restrepo, but she did not reply.

Salama acknowledged there are data on these cases, but suggested there isn’t enough there to know that it’s safe to give this vaccine to pregnant women. “So far we don’t have any evidence — again, it’s very preliminary — to suggest major adverse outcomes related to vaccination,” he said. “But that’s based on an extremely small sample size.”

Still, Faden, Karron, and Krubiner argue that in the face of plenty of evidence that Ebola infection is generally deadly for pregnant women and their fetuses, the greater risk lies in not vaccinating pregnant women exposed to Ebola in this outbreak.

“It’s just unfair,” Faden said. “You’ve got other segments of the population who are at the same, or probably in some cases, less risk than pregnant women, and they’re being provided vaccine. Pregnant women are not being provided vaccine without adequate justification.”

In other outbreak developments, the country's health officials decided not to postpone the Sep 3 start of the school year in the outbreak-affected area.

On Twitter yesterday, Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's director-general of emergency preparedness and response, said the majority of new cases are from known contact lists and most are still confined to an area within 20 kilometers (km) to 30 km of the outbreak's epicenter. However, if responders can't turn the outbreak around over the next 7 to 10 days, the risk of the disease spreading to more dangerous conflict-ridden areas becomes greater, posing more difficult challenges for health teams.

Salama also noted that the percentage of contacts that are being followed daily ranged from 71% to 97% in the last week, a measure that's improving as response teams engage communities to gain access. He said that, of 3,714 contacts that have been registered, 1,219 have completed follow-up.

Another promising sign is what appears to be a declining number of cases on the epidemiologic curve, which Salama said could signal that control measures are working. He warned, though, that the information must be interpreted cautiously, given that it takes time to include the latest cases and that the risk of spread remains high. New cases are still being reported daily, he said. ""The fight continues.""

Outbreak total at 112

The newest confirmed case is a patient from Mandima who is a known contact of a previous case, and the development raises the outbreak total to 112 cases, 84 of them confirmed and 28 classified as probable, according to the latest DRC health ministry update yesterday. Three people recovered from their illnesses, and no new deaths were reported.

Health officials are investigating 18 suspected cases, up from 10 reported on Aug 27. Two of the patients are from the city of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, near the border with Rwanda.

Extra measures for the start of school

In another development, the ministry said an expert group that met to assess if the start of the school year should be postponed in the affected areas said it was better to open the schools as planned. However, wash basins with chlorinated water will be placed at the entrances of 250 schools in the outbreak areas, and school principals and teachers will receive Ebola disease training.

UNICEF yesterday said more than 82,500 children in the Ebola-affected areas are getting ready to start school and the group is stepping up its education, health, sanitation, and hygiene programs to help the schools protect students and teachers.

Gianfranco Rotigliano, MD, UNICEF's representative in the DRC, said in the statement that every effort must go into ensuring a smooth and safe start for the new school years. ""Education is a right for every child and essential for children to develop to their full potential. Especially in times of crisis such as an Ebola outbreak,"" he added.

Aside from training about 1,750 teachers in installing hand washing units, UNICEF and its partners are also organizing communications activities for parents and local officials and distributing laser thermometers to schools for monitoring children's health.

Latest WHO assessment

In its latest situation report yesterday, the WHO said health officials have investigated alerts in several DRC provinces, as well as in the neighboring countries of Burundi, Central African Republic, Rwanda, and Uganda. So far, Ebola has been ruled out in all instances.

Of 14 confirmed cases reported over the past 7 days, 9 (64%) were among known contacts, an indicator that is steadily improving, the WHO said. ""Nonetheless, this result suggests that there are still potential undocumented chains of transmission in the affected communities.""

The number of beds in Ebola treatment centers in Mangina and Beni are increasing, and a 50-bed unit to be run by the International Medical Corps is being constructed in Ituri province and is expected to be operational within 2 week.

Though a lot of progress has been made on many fronts, the WHO said there are still some urgent issues, such as deaths from suspected Ebola in the community that heighten the risk of spread, cases occurring outside of known transmission chains, and reluctance and resistance to public health actions by some communities. ""The events unfolding in the coming days and weeks will, therefore, be critical in the evolution of the outbreak,"" the agency said.

Aug 28 UNICEF statement

Aug 28 WHO situation report",no result found,no result found,"DAKAR (Reuters) - It is too soon to say that an outbreak of Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo is stabilizing due to difficulties identifying new cases near rebel-controlled areas, World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday.

Since the latest outbreak was declared on Aug. 1, 112 confirmed and probable cases have been identified in eastern Congo’s North Kivu and Ituri provinces, including 75 deaths, according to overnight data from Congo’s health ministry.

Some areas close to the outbreak’s epicenter in the town of Mangina are off-limits to health workers for security reasons, hampering efforts to control the spread of the disease.

“If one case is hidden in the red zone or an inaccessible area, it’s dangerous. It can just spark a fire, just one case,” Tedros told Reuters on the sidelines of a news conference.

“There is a decline (in new cases)... but still, considering the accessibility and red zones, we cannot say that the outbreak is stabilizing,” he told journalists earlier, adding that the next seven to ten days would be critical to controlling the outbreak.

His words echoed warnings from the International Federation of Red Cross and International Rescue Committee, which on Wednesday called for prompt action to avert a repeat of the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. More than 11,000 people were killed in that outbreak.

Congo has experienced 10 outbreaks of Ebola since it was discovered in the country’s forested north in 1976. The disease causes haemmorhagic fever and usually kills about half of the people it infects.

“Without a swift, concerted and efficient response, this outbreak has the potential to be the worst ever seen,” IRC said in a statement.

The current response has been aided by a new vaccine, which proved effective against Congo’s last outbreak earlier this year, and experimental treatments that are being used for the first time.

More than 4,500 health workers and contacts of Ebola cases have been vaccinated and at least 17 patients have received treatments. Tedros said all of them were doing well.

“Now we have vaccines and we have therapeutics and no one should really die of Ebola. But for this to happen first of all we need to identify cases as early as possible,” he said.

The WHO has asked a number of countries as well as local religious leaders and chiefs to negotiate access to ‘red zones’ with rebel groups in the area, he said.",no result found

There is one newly confirmed case, however in Mabalaka, as well as two new fatalities in probable cases in Beni.

Outbreak totals now stand at 115 cases, 85 of them confirmed, 30 probable, according to an update from the DRC ministry of health. Seventy-seven people have died. One person has recovered from his or her illness.

Currently, 10 cases remain under investigation, but one of two suspected cases announced yesterday in Goma has been ruled out.

Goma is the capital of North Kivu province, and is near the border with Rwanda. A confirmed case there would increase the risk of the virus spreading internationally.

Yesterday DRC Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, visited North Kivu to assess the situation. He fielded questions on the impending start of the school year, and maintained school should begin on schedule but surveillance and hygiene throughout the district should be heightened. According to UNICEF, 82,500 children in the Ebola-affected areas are set to begin school in the coming weeks.

The DRC also updated its vaccination numbers. Since vaccination with Merck's unlicensed vaccine began on Aug 8, 4,645 people have been vaccinated, including 2,372 in Mabalako, 1,135 in Beni, 1,017 in Mandima, and 121 in Oicha.

19 patients on experimental treatments

On Twitter today, Peter Salama, MD, the World Health Organization's (WHO's) director-general of emergency preparedness and response, said 19 patients have received experimental Ebola treatments, including mAb114, ZMapp, and remdesivir.

Two of those patients have recovered and been discharged, 16 are currently receiving treatment, and 1 person has died. Salama said that person arrived at the Ebola treatment center (ETC) in the late stages of disease. He also said most patients are being offered treatments within hours of arriving at ETCs.

This is the first outbreak in which Ebola treatments have been used.

Strengthening DRC's health system

Also today, the WHO hosted a live Facebook session with Mike Ryan, MD, assistant director-general for emergency preparedness and response. Ryan answered some basic questions on the nature of Ebola and filoviruses and provided some new details about the response effort in North Kivu.

Ryan said the DRC's national healthcare system was at the root of its recent Ebola outbreaks, while at the same time applauding the efforts of DRC health workers who have risked their lives to contain the virus.

""We have a weak health system, and many cases have been associated with healthcare settings,"" Ryan said. ""This country requires a massive investment in its health system,"" he added, noting that bolstering the DRC system is a global public health investment.

At this point, however, Ryan said the goal of the WHO and its partners is containing the spread of the disease.

""We've had a few scares, including two confirmed cases in red zones,"" Ryan said. ""We need to contain the virus in North Kivu and prevent its extension into other provinces and other countries. At the moment we seem to be winning, but [it's] cautious optimism.""

31-Aug-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is at a key juncture. Recent trends (Figure 1) suggest that control measures are working. Over the past week, contact follow-up rates have substantially improved, most patients recently admitted to Ebola treatment centres (ETC) received therapeutics within hours of being confirmed, and ring vaccination activities have scaled to reach contacts (and their contacts) of most confirmed cases reported in the last three weeks. However, the outbreak trend must be interpreted with caution. Since the last Disease Outbreak News on 24 August 2018, 13 additional confirmed and probable cases have been reported, the majority (n=8) were from the city of Beni. Moreover, substantial risks remain, posed by potential undocumented chains of transmission; four of the 13 new cases were not known contacts. Likewise, sporadic instances of high-risk behaviours in some communities (such as unsafe burials, reluctance towards contact tracing, vaccination and admission to ETCs if symptoms developed), poor infection prevention and control (IPC) practices in some community health centres, and delays in patients reaching ETCs when symptoms develop, all have the potential to further propagate the outbreak.

As of 29 August 2018, a total of 116 EVD cases (86 confirmed and 30 probable) including 77 deaths (47 confirmed and 30 probable)1 have been reported in five health zones in North Kivu (Beni, Butembo, Oicha, Mabalako, Musienene) and one health zone in Ituri (Mandima). Eight suspected cases from Mabalako (n=5) and Beni (n=3) are currently pending laboratory testing to confirm or exclude EVD. The majority of cases (65 confirmed and 21 probable) have been reported from Mabalako Health Zone (Figure 2). The median age of confirmed and probable cases is 35 years (interquartile range 19–45.5 years), and 56% were female (Figure 3).

Fifteen cases have been reported among health workers, of which 14 were laboratory confirmed; one has died. All health worker exposures likely occurred in health facilities outside of the dedicated ETCs. WHO and partners continue to work with health workers and communities to increase awareness on IPC measures, as well as vaccinate those at risk of infection.

In addition to the ongoing response activities within outbreak affected areas, the MoH, WHO and partners will be implementing a 30-day strategic plan to ensure operational readiness measures against EVD are strengthened in all provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The first phase of implementation will prioritise six provinces at highest risk of case importations: South Kivu, Maniema, Ituri, Tanganika, Haut Uele and Bas Uele. The main objective is to ensure that these provinces implement essential operational readiness measures, including enhancing surveillance, IPC and social mobilization to mitigate, rapidly detect, investigate and effectively respond to a possible outbreak of EVD.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include response coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC, clinical management, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, safe and dignified burials, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

As of 29 August, 2444 contacts remain under surveillance, of which 79–97% were followed-up daily during the past seven days. During this period, contact tracing teams have faced and are working to overcome many challenges, including community refusal in some areas, insecurity and the movement of contacts making them hard to follow.

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to systematically monitor and rapidly investigate all alerts in all provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries.

As of 29 August, 26 vaccination rings have been defined and four additional rings are being defined. Vaccination teams have been vaccinating these rings which include the contacts and the contacts of contacts of 44 recently confirmed cases from the last 21 days.

As of 30 August, over 5130 contacts and contacts of contacts have been vaccinated, of which over 1040 are health care or front line workers and over 1340 are children. More than 7000 additional doses of vaccine have been transported to Beni to supplement doses currently in place and additional doses (2160) arrived on 29 August from the United States.

As of 30 August, WHO has deployed over 180 multidisciplinary specialists to support response activities including logisticians, epidemiologists, laboratory experts, communicators, clinical care specialists, community engagement specialists, and emergency coordinators. Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions continue to support the response as well as ongoing readiness and preparedness activities in non-affected provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in neighbouring countries.

ETCs are fully operational in Beni and Mangina with support from The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) respectively. MSF opened a seven bed transit center in Makeke on 9 August. International Medical Corps (IMC) is planning on establishing an ETC in Makeke which will then replace the transit center. ETCs are providing therapeutics under the monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions (MEURI) protocol in collaboration with the MoH and the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB). WHO is providing technical clinical expertise onsite and is assisting with the creation of a data safety management board.

For the first time, there is regulatory and ethical approval to provide access to five investigational Ebola therapeutics under the MEURI framework for people infected with Ebola virus disease. Three are already in use (mAb114, Remdesivir (GS5734) and ZMapp) and more may follow (REGN3470-3471-3479 and Favipiravir). To date, 20 patients have received investigational therapeutics: 13 mAb 114, 5 remdisivir, and 2 ZMapp.

A team of IPC specialists are holding daily training with healthcare and frontline workers, assessing and decontaminating facilities, and providing essential hand hygiene solutions and personal protective equipment. A team of experts deployed by WHO are supplementing local capacity, working with dozens of health care centres identifying areas requiring strengthening, and providing training and supplies as needed. They are assisting the health centres to set up triage to ensure that patients with suspected Ebola can be separated and treated away from other patients, to reduce the risk of the disease spreading.

The MOH, WHO, UNICEF, the Red Cross and partners are intensifying activities to engage with local communities in Beni and Mutembo. Local leaders, religious leaders, opinion leaders, and community networks such as youth groups, motorbike taxi drivers are engaged with to support community outreach for Ebola prevention and early care seeking through active dialogues on radio and interpersonal communication. Local frontline community outreach workers are working closely across Ebola response teams to strengthen community engagement and psychosocial support in contact tracing, patient care and safe and dignified burials.

From 6 through 8 August, Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) surveys were conducted on 335 individuals in Mabalako and Beni and found that there was a high level of awareness on EVD (76%). However, it was also found that there was a low level of knowledge on EVD transmission and prevention (22%) and low level of knowledge of the EVD vaccine (23%). The second KAP survey is planned for the week of 8 September. A community feedback mechanism for collecting feedback, questions, complaints and rumours to inform localized community engagement strategies is established to adapt risk communication and community engagement strategies to community needs.

The Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is responding to the current EVD outbreak in North Kivu with Safe and Dignified Burials (SDB). As of 29 August 2018, 10 SDB teams are operational in Beni, Mangina, Butembo, Bunia and Mambasa. As of 29 August, 80 SDBs have been successful conducted.

As of 27 August 2018, 34 Points of Entry (PoE) in North Kivu are functional with health screening activities and the total number of alerts from these PoEs to this date is 36.

WHO risk assessment

This latest outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo which border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing several epidemics and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri may hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public health risk was assessed to be high at the national and regional levels, and low globally.

As the risk of national and regional spread remains high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure health authorities are alerted and are operationally ready to respond.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event.

One more case has been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) latest Ebola outbreak, in a patient from Beni, the health ministry said yesterday in its latest update.

The development raises the outbreak total to 116, which includes 86 confirmed and 30 probable cases. Health officials are still investigating 8 suspected cases, including those involving 3 people who died in community settings, a factor known to increase the risk of virus transmission in Ebola outbreaks.

In Beni, Health Minister Oly Ilunga, MD, led city and district officials, as well as other community leaders, on tours of the outbreak response center and the town's Ebola treatment center to give them a better understanding of case management and to respond to community concerns about the epidemic and patient care.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in an update today that over the past week contact follow-up has improved, most patients admitted for treatment have received therapeutics within hours of case confirmation, and ring vaccination has reached most contacts of confirmed cases.

The agency urged caution, however, in light of the promising trends, noting that 13 confirmed and probable cases have been reported since its last update on Aug 24, 8 of them in Beni. The WHO also said substantial risks remain from possible undocumented transmission chains; of the 13 most recent cases, 4 were among unknown contacts.

Also, it said sporadic high-risk behaviors in some communities have been reported, such as unsafe burials and reluctance to cooperate with contact tracing, vaccination efforts, and admission to Ebola treatment centers. The WHO added that gaps in infection prevention and control in some community health centers and delays in some patients reaching treatment centers also have the potential to fuel the outbreak.

As of Aug 30, 5,130 contacts and their contacts have been vaccinated. The WHO said 20 patients have now received investigational treatments: 13 mAB114, 5 remdisivir, and 2 zMapp.

Saudi Arabia reports more MERS-CoV cases

Saudi Arabia's health ministry has reported five MERS-CoV cases so far for the month of August, three involving camel contact, according to posts covering epidemiologic weeks 31, 32, 33, and 35.

During the first week of the month, the ministry reported two MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) case-patients, a 55-year-old man from Hufoof in the eastern part of the country who recovered and an 82-year-old woman from Tabuk in the far northwest who died from her infection. Both had contact with camels before they got sick.

The following week, officials reported an illness in a 41-year-old man living in Dammam in Saudi Arabia's Eastern province. An investigation also revealed that he had contact with camels before his symptoms began. He has recovered.

In reports for epidemiologic week 33 and 35, the ministry reported infections in an 80-year-old man from the city of Buljorshy in the southwest who died and a 77-year-old man from Alzulfi in in the centrally located Riyadh province who is hospitalized. Investigators found that neither of the men had contact with camels.

The latest illnesses from Saudi Arabia, combined with a travel-related case reported last week from the United Kingdom, appear to lift the global MERS-CoV total to 2,243 cases and the number of deaths from the disease to 795.

Four countries from 3 parts of the world report more polio cases

In its latest weekly update, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) reported new polio cases in four countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, the DRC, and Papua New Guinea.

In Afghanistan, one more wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported, involving a patient from Nangahar province who had a Jul 17 paralysis onset. The country has now had 12 WPV1 cases in 2018.

Meanwhile, Nigeria, which is experiencing two separate circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) outbreaks, reported three new cases, two from different locations in Jigwa state that had Jun 27 and Jul 24 symptom onsets and one in Katsina state with a Jul 27 illness onset. Nigeria's cVDPV2 total for the year now stands at eight.

The DRC, which is affected by three separate cVDPV2 strains, said two patients who were contacts of negative acute flaccid paralysis case-patients from Mongala province have been classified as case-patients. The country has now reported 13 such cases in 2018.

Elsewhere, Papua New Guinea, which is experiencing a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) outbreak, reported two new cases, one in Madang province with a symptom onset of Jul 11 and one in Eastern Highland province with a Jul 26 illness onset. The country has now reported six 2018 cVDPV1 cases from four provinces.

CDC confirms new H1N2v flu case, raising season total to 13

For the fourth straight week the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed variant H1N2 (H1N2v) flu, this time in a case in Ohio.

The new case involves a child who contracted the disease after exposure to swine at an agricultural fair, which is a common risk factor for variant flu strains. The child is still recovering from the illness but did not require hospitalization, the CDC said in a FluView update today.

The new H1N2v cases bring the total this year to 13, with the most in California (6), followed by Ohio (4) and Michigan (3). Since 2011, the CDC has confirmed only 25 H1N2v cases. The only other variant flu case reported so far this year in the United States was caused by the much more common H3N2v strain, in a patient in Indiana.

""Early identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can be more fully understood and appropriate public health measures can be taken,"" the CDC said.

Scientists report international avian flu travel involving wild duck in Alaska

For the fourth time in 7 years scientists have reported international spread of influenza A viruses via migratory birds, this time involving a Eurasian-origin H8N4 virus identified in a northern pintail duck in Alaska, according to a study yesterday in Emerging Infectious Diseases.

The isolate was among 541 samples collected by US Geological Survey scientists from hunter-harvested waterfowl taken in the fall of 2016 in western Alaska. It shared more than 99% of its genetic material with isolates recovered from wild and domestic birds in East Asia from 2006 through 2016. It also shared that genetic closeness with avian flu isolates collected in western Alaska in 2012 through 2015 but not with an H8N4 isolate collected in the state from a northern pintail in 1997.

Those data indicate that the new H8N4 isolate ""might represent a previously unidentified or unreported genome constellation,"" the authors wrote. They added, ""Phylogenetic analyses provided support for Eurasian ancestry of this genomic constellation.""

The other three reports of intercontinental travel of avian flu viruses involved H16N3, H9N2, and highly pathogenic H5N8.

The researchers conclude, ""Evidence for repeated introductions of influenza A viruses into North America by migratory birds suggests that intercontinental dispersal might not be exceedingly rare and that our understanding of viral establishment is incomplete.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Efforts to halt an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Democratic Republic of Congo appear to be working, but substantial risks remain, the World Health Organization said on Friday.

The outbreak has so far killed 77 people in Congo’s North Kivu and Ituri provinces among 116 cases. Fifteen of the cases were healthworkers.

“Recent trends suggest that control measures are working,” a WHO statement said, citing improving figures for tracing patients’ contacts, rapid treatment of Ebola patients with therapeutic drugs and vaccinations of people at risk.

A previous outbreak in Congo this year was swiftly stopped, despite the remote location and difficult terrain.

The latest outbreak presents a different challenge, occurring in a more densely populated area with dozens of armed groups. Some areas are off-limits to healthworkers due to the security risks, making it more difficult to ring-fence each Ebola case by vaccinating all the patient’s contacts.

On Wednesday WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was too soon to say whether the outbreak was stabilizing due to the difficulty of identifying new cases near rebel-controlled areas.

“Substantial risks remain, posed by potential undocumented chains of transmission,” Friday’s WHO statement said, adding that four of the 13 new probable and confirmed cases in the past week were not known to have had contact with any Ebola patients.

There were also risks from unsafe burial practices and people’s reluctance to accept contact tracing, vaccination and healthcare, as well as poor standards in some health centers and delays in getting patients to treatment.",no result found

As of yesterday, 81 people have died since the outbreak began at the start of August; 51 of those deaths occurred in confirmed cases. Fourteen suspected cases are under investigation, officials said.

New data from the DRC released Sep 2 showed there have been more Ebola cases in women during this outbreak, and the most affected age-group among women is 25 to 34. Men ages 35 to 44 are most likely to have been infected.

School begins as teachers voice concern

Children in the DRC started school yesterday in Beni and Mangina, the epicenters of the outbreak where the new cases have occurred, officials said.

A teachers union in Beni expressed concerns about their role in the Ebola outbreak, but talks between union leaders and outbreak response team members did not delay the beginning of the school year.

Last week, officials said school would start on time this year, with enhanced hygiene practices and surveillance measures.

Violence in Beni

Since Aug 8, 5,946 people have been vaccinated against Ebola virus using Merck's unlicensed vaccone, including 3,076 in Mabalako, 1,633 in Beni, 1,067 in Mandima, 121 in Oicha, 30 in Katwa, and 19 in Kinshasa.

Three days ago, Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's director-general of emergency preparedness and response, confirmed on Twitter that 8,000 doses of the vaccine were in place in the DRC and will continued to be used in a ring vaccination campaign.

But despite ample supplies, World Health Organization (WHO) workers have an ongoing challenge with completing surveillance and vaccine activities in the region. Earlier today, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, tweeted about a violent attack near Beni.

""Just been briefed on a violent attack near Beni in DRC last night, an Ebola-affected area. All WHO staff safe. This is not acceptable. We condemn this attack and call for a cessation of hostilities. Ebola is dangerous to all: we must focus on fighting Ebola, not each other,"" he said.

Many WHO officials have said the most challenging aspect to this outbreak is its location, a border region where over 100 different militias and rebel groups fight for power. The area is also home to more than 1 million refugees.

Tedros Ghebreyesus Twitter feed","Ebola fears have caused school attendance to plummet in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The Health Ministry says the death toll from Ebola has risen to 75 since the epidemic was declared in August.

Al Jazeera’s Victoria Gatenby reports",no result found,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Two South African peacekeepers were wounded in a rebel ambush near the epicenter of an Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, their U.N. mission said on Tuesday.

The attack on Monday on the outskirts of the city of Beni underscored the challenges authorities face in tackling a flare-up of the deadly disease in an active conflict zone stalked by dozens of armed groups.

Health officials say they have made progress slowing the hemorrhagic fever’s spread with experimental vaccines and treatments. But they cannot be sure the situation is under control due to difficulties accessing some areas.

The peacekeepers’ patrol was attacked in the town of Ngadi by militants believed to belong to the Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan Islamist group active in eastern Congo, said Florence Marchal, spokeswoman for the U.N. mission known as MONUSCO.

“Two soldiers were wounded and their condition was deemed stable this morning,” she told Reuters.

The current Ebola outbreak is believed to have killed 81 people since July and infected another 40. Nineteen of those cases have been in Beni, a city of several hundred thousand people with close trading links to neighboring Uganda.

The outbreak is Congo’s 10th since Ebola was discovered in 1976 in the country’s north, but the first to affect its densely-populated eastern borderlands.

MONUSCO peacekeepers are providing near-daily escorts to the town of Oicha, where one case has been confirmed, World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters in Geneva.

On Twitter today, Peter Salama, MD, director-general of emergency preparedness with the World Health Organization (WHO), said the patient who died in Butembo was from Beni. He said the case increases the risk of spread and added that having Ebola in an urban center makes ending the outbreak much harder.

Butembo, North Kivu province's second largest city, is a commercial center and transportation hub with an airport that is not far from the border with Uganda.

Salama added, however, that the good news is the case was detected quickly and the response is already in place and expanding.

Beni cases amid community resistance

Three more Ebola cases have been confirmed, two from Beni and one from Mabalako, the DRC's health ministry said yesterday in its update. Also, one more probable case was reported in Beni, which involved a person who was buried before samples were taken. The developments push the total number of cases to 124, which includes 93 confirmed and 31 probable cases.

Also, health officials are investigating 16 suspected cases. Four more deaths were reported, lifting the outbreak's fatality total to 85.

According to the health ministry, Ndindi district in Beni has become the main focus of the outbreak and is where 70% of the last 20 confirmed cases were reported. It said the cases are occurring amid resistance among the community to working with health authorities. For example, some families are hiding sick people, preventing health providers from taking patients to Ebola treatment centers, and refusing to be vaccinated.

Several violent incidents against medical staff and care facilities have also been reported, the ministry said. To ease tensions, it noted that community dialogue has been launched between outbreak coordinators and Ndindi community leaders.

In other outbreak developments, vaccinations topped 6,000 and are at 6,134, and 22 patients have been treated with one of three experimental therapies: mAb114, remdesivir, and ZMapp. Of those, 11 recovered, 4 died, and 7 are still hospitalized but are improving.

Mangina may be stabilizing

In its latest situation report, the WHO said Sep 1 marked 1 month since the Ebola outbreak was declared in North Kivu and Ituri provinces and that the health ministry, the WHO, and their partners have made progress. With new confirmed cases and deaths declining, the agency said recent patterns suggest control measures are working but warned that the trends should be interpreted with caution.

Though the situation in Mangina, the outbreak's epicenter, seems to be stabilizing, Beni has become the new hot spot, the WHO said. In Beni health zone, the number of confirmed and probable cases rose from 8 on Aug 23 to 19 on Sep 2.

Since the start of the outbreak, 4,296 contacts have been registered, of which 58.5% are still under surveillance. Daily follow-up has been completed for 92% to 97% of the contacts, the WHO said. As of Sep 3, 38 vaccination rings have been defined, in addition to 5 rings of health workers and other frontline health staff.

Last weekend in Butembo, risk communication and community engagement teams held a briefing on Ebola prevention and control with more than 500 religious leaders. Officials also sponsored a workshop with 40 traditional healers to encourage them to refer patients with Ebola-like symptoms to treatment centers.

Sep 4 DRC health ministry update

Sep 4 WHO situation update",no result found,no result found,"GOMA, Congo (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo has recorded its first death from Ebola in the eastern trading hub of Butembo, a city of almost a million with links to Uganda that could complicate efforts to control the outbreak, health officials said on Wednesday.

The epidemic is believed to have killed 85 people since July and infected another 39. Most have been in villages but about 20 cases have been in Beni, a city of several hundred thousand people with close links to Uganda.

Butembo, about 55 km (35 miles) away, is two or three times the size of Beni. It straddles a major trading route for consumer goods entering Congo from East Africa and for Congolese exports of artisanal gold, coltan, timber and other materials to East African ports via Uganda.

“Ebola case from Beni has died in Butembo DRC,” Peter Salama, the World Health Organization’s head of emergency operations, wrote on Twitter.

“Good news is case detected quickly, response already in place and expanding. Bad new(s) is increases risk of further spread, and having Ebola in an urban center makes ending the outbreak much harder,” he said.

Butembo’s mayor Sylvain Kanyamanda said the victim was a woman who was likely infected as a result of participating in an unsafe burial. She died in a university clinic.

“We call on the population to exercise caution and to respect all hygiene measures recommended by health workers,” he said.

Health officials say they have made progress slowing the virus’s spread with experimental vaccines and treatments. But they cannot be sure the situation is under control due to difficulties accessing some areas.

According to an outbreak update from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), officials recorded three more confirmed cases of Ebola yesterday, including one in a patient who died in Butembo, a major city in North Kivu province.

The other confirmed cases include one each in Mabalako and Mandima. The new cases raise outbreak totals to 127, of which 96 confirmed and 31 probable. There have been 87 deaths. Four cases are still under investigation.

The DRC offered new details about the patient in Butombo, who was a contact from a confirmed case in Beni. An official from the World Health Organization first reported the case early yesterday. This is the first case in Butembo, North Kivu province's second largest city, which has an airport and is not far from the border with Uganda.

The patient ""refused to cooperate with the health authorities and fled to Butembo after falling ill. He died at Butembo University Hospital. The hospital's health staff, having already been trained on how to deal with suspected cases, complied with individual protection measures. The burial has been secured,"" the DRC said.

A surveillance team was already in place in Butembo after officials had tracked several contacts of cases in Beni who had moved into the city. Yesterday, DRC’s Ebola Response Coordinator, Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe, MD, traveled to Butembo to set up a response team, a mobile laboratory, and a new Ebola treatment center—the fifth constructed during this outbreak. Vaccination of identified first contacts was also able to begin, the DRC said.

A total of 6,343 people have now been vaccinated during this outbreak, up by more than 200 from the day before. Yesterday's total includes 3,210 in Mabalako, 1,856 in Beni, 1,067 in Mandima, 121 in Oicha, 70 in Katwa (Butembo), and 19 in Kinshasa.

Final CDC report notes 101 Salmonella cases linked to Hy-Vee pasta salad

Late yesterday the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued its final update on a multistate Salmonella outbreak connected to pasta salad sold at Hy-Vee grocery stores and said the outbreak appears to be over.

A total of 101 people in 10 states were infected with Salmonella Sandiego (92 people), Salmonella enterica subspecies IIIb (7 people), or both (2 people). Twenty-five people were hospitalized, but no deaths were recorded.

Illness onsets ranged from Jun 21 to Aug 7, and the median case-patient age was 50. Most cases (61%) involved women. Iowa, where Hy-Vee is headquartered, had the most cases (37), followed by Minnesota (23), South Dakota (19), and Nebraska (11). Kansas and Missouri each had 3 cases, Illinois had 2, and North Dakota, Oregon, and Tennessee each reported 1 case.

England's top medical officer wants deaths from drug resistance recorded

England's chief medical officer is calling for antibiotic-resistant infections to be recorded on death certificates, according to reports in the British press.

The Guardian reports that Dame Sally Davies told British members of parliament on the Health and Social Care Select Committee on Tuesday that recording deaths from drug-resistant infections would raise public awareness of antibiotic resistance.

""I would really love death certificates to collect when people die of infections and if resistance has been involved, because that would really wake people up to the deaths as they happen,"" Davies said.

Davies said England's National Health Service (NHS) rarely tells families when a loved one has died of a resistant infection, because doing so would make it look like the service is failing patients.

Davies, a leading voice on the dangers of antibiotic resistance, also warned that unless more effective measures were introduced to contain the spread of drug-resistant infections, advanced medical procedures and organ transplants will be threatened. ""There will be a lot of suffering, and modern medicine will be lost,"" she said.

7-Sep-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

1 September 2018 marked one month since the declaration of this Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Good progress has been made in detecting and responding rapidly to new cases, and providing protection and therapeutics where appropriate. However, significant risks remain that could lead to further spread of this outbreak: reluctance by some communities to adopt Ebola prevention measures, transmission in health care facilities because of weak infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, delays in patients reaching Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) once they develop symptoms, and potential for the virus to spread to insecure areas that will be more difficult to access.

In recent weeks, we observed a slight increase in case incidence (Figure 1). The focus of transmission has shifted from in and around Mangina in Mabalako Health Zone to the city of Beni; 15 of the 22 confirmed and probable cases in Beni, and at least 3 confirmed cases in other health zones, have been linked to a single transmission chain. Since the last Disease Outbreak News on 31 August (data as of 29 August), 13 new EVD cases (12 confirmed and one probable) were reported, including eight confirmed and one probable from Beni, two from Mabalako, and one each from Mandima, Butembo and Masereka health zones. While the situation has significantly improved in Mangina and Mandima health zones, sporadic cases are still being observed. The risk of spread was heightened by the movement of two, subsequently confirmed, cases from Beni to the city of Butembo and a nearby village in Masereka Health Zone (Figure 2). Given the mobility of populations in the affected areas, these two cases were expected, rapidly detected and additional response measures swiftly activated to interrupt further spread of the virus.

As of 5 September 2018, a total of 129 EVD cases (98 confirmed and 31 probable), including 89 deaths (58 confirmed and 31 probable) have been reported in seven health zones in North Kivu Province (Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Mabalako, Masereka, Musienene and Oicha), as well as Mandima health zone in Ituri Province (Figure 2). While cases have been recorded in other areas, recent confirmed transmission events were localized to Beni, Mabalako and Mandima health zones. Of 123 probable and confirmed cases with known age and sex, adults aged 35–44 years (24%) and females (58%) accounted for the greatest proportion of confirmed and probable cases (Figure 3). Seventeen cases have been reported among health workers, of which 16 were laboratory-confirmed: Mabalako (14), Beni (1) and Masereka (1). All health worker exposures occurred in health facilities in Mandima and Beni outside of dedicated ETCs. Two health workers died. In addition to confirmed and probable cases, seven suspected cases from Mabalako (5), Beni (1), and Mandima (1) are currently pending laboratory testing to confirm or exclude EVD.

The presence of response teams and the implementation of Ebola control measures have by and large been accepted and supported by local communities in the affected areas. In some areas challenges remain. Teams are continuing to address sporadic instances of reluctance towards response activities.

Instances of insecurity and conflict in the immediate vicinity of response activities are also being monitored closely. WHO and UN security teams ensure that internal safety policies and procedures are strictly observed and complied with. The UN policy for the use of armed escorts (as applied in past outbreaks), continues to be observed with the use of military escorts in separate vehicles only when required, but with no direct involvement of security personnel in the response operations.

Public health response

The Ministry of Health (MoH) continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC, clinical management, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, safe and dignified burials, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces. WHO and partners are also conducting preparedness activities in neighbouring countries.

Over 4500 contacts have been registered to date, of which over 2100 have completed 21 days of follow-up. As of 5 September, 2265 contacts remain under surveillance, of which 93–97% were followed-up daily during the past seven days. In some areas, contact tracing teams have faced various degrees of community refusal, but also insecurity and challenges posed by the continuous movement of contacts.

As of 6 September, 44 vaccination rings have been defined, in addition to ten rings of health workers and other frontline workers. These rings include the contacts (and their contacts) of the 52 most recently confirmed cases. To date, 6830 people consented and were vaccinated, including 1746 health care or front line workers, and 1762 children.

As of 5 September, WHO has deployed 194 experts to support response activities including logisticians, epidemiologists, laboratory experts, communicators, clinical care specialists, community engagement specialists, and emergency coordinators. Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions continue to support the response as well as readiness and preparedness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries.

The sub-national Health Cluster Coordinator who was deployed in Kananga through the Standby Partner (SBP) NORCAP, has been reassigned to North Kivu to support the EVD response. Efforts are ongoing to backfill positions through additional SBP deployments. SBPs are also prepared to support and deploy health professionals for EVD preparedness and response activates.

ETCs are fully operational in Beni and Mangina with support from The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). In Beni, ALIMA are planning to expand treatment cube capacity over the next 2 weeks. A 20 bed ETC is being constructed in Makeke (Ituri Province) with the support of International Medical Corps (IMC), which is expected to be operational during the week of 9 September. A seven bed MSF transit centre is already operational in Makeke. Samaritan's Purse continue to support the isolation unit in Bunia with infection, IPC and isolation training.

ETCs continue to provide therapeutics under the monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions (MEURI) protocol in collaboration with the MoH and the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB). WHO is providing technical clinical expertise onsite and is assisting with the creation of a data safety management board. As of 6 September, 27 patients have received investigational Ebola therapeutics, including: mAb114 (13 patients), Remdesivir (9 patients) and ZMapp (5 patients).

A team of IPC specialists is holding daily training with health care and frontline workers, assessing and decontaminating facilities, and providing essential hand hygiene solutions and personal protective equipment. A team of experts deployed by WHO are supplementing local capacity, working with dozens of health care centres to see where there are gaps, and providing training and supplies as needed. They are assisting the health centres to set up triage to ensure that patients with suspected EBV can be separated and treated away from other patients, to decrease transmission risks.

The MoH, WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Red Cross and partners are intensifying activities to engage with local communities in Beni, Butembo and Mangina. Local leaders, religious leaders, opinion leaders, and community networks such as youth groups and motorbike taxi drivers are being engaged to support community outreach for Ebola prevention and early care seeking through active dialogues on radio and interpersonal communication. Local frontline community outreach workers are working closely with Ebola response teams to strengthen community engagement and psychosocial support in contact tracing, patient care and safe and dignified burials (SDBs).

As of 6 September, over 642 religion leaders, traditional healers, magistrates/judges and teachers were oriented to support the encouragement of community members to practice Ebola prevention measures, seek early treatment and assist with surveillance, SDB and other response measures.

The Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with support from the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), are coordinating SDB. As of 6 September, Red Cross has established 3 operational bases in Beni, Mangina and Butembo; in total nine SDB teams are operational, and initial training has been conducted for teams in Bunia and Mambasa. To date, 112 SDBs are reported to have been successfully conducted.

Health screening has been established at 45 Points of Entry (PoE). More than two million travellers have been screened at these PoE.

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri may hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public health risk was assessed to be high at the national and regional levels, and low globally.

As the risk of national and regional spread remains high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure health authorities are alerted and are operationally ready to respond.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no countries have implemented any travel restriction to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

The case involves a health worker from Beni who refused follow-up and vaccination after potential exposure, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) health ministry said yesterday.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said in its update today that the risk of spread is heightened by the movement of two cases from Beni, the one in Masereka Health Zone and a case confirmed earlier this week that marked the first spread to Butembo, home to nearly 1 million people.

The developments, however, aren't surprising, the WHO said. ""Given the mobility of populations in the affected areas, these two cases were expected, rapidly detected, and additional response measures swiftly activated to interrupt further spread of the virus.""

Overall, the WHO said transmission focus has shifted to Beni, but it warned that sporadic cases are still being reported in Mangina and Mandima health zones, the outbreak's earlier hot spots.

Health teams continue to face sporadic reluctance to response activities in the outbreak areas, the agency said. It added that insecurity and conflict activity is also closely being monitored in the affected areas, and, as in earlier outbreaks, officials are following the United Nations policy of using armed military escorts in separate vehicles when needed. The WHO said security personnel aren't directly involved in response operations.

Latest health ministry numbers

The latest confirmed cases include the one from Masereka Health Zone and another from Beni, the health ministry said yesterday. The developments push the outbreak total to 129, including 98 confirmed and 31 probable cases. Health officials are investigating 7 suspected cases.

Health ministry Oly Ilunga, MD, traveled to Beni yesterday and with other high-level health officials took part in a public information session in Ndindi district, where some residents have hid sick patients, obstructed response activities, and refused vaccination. The group also flew to Butembo to meet with response teams and deliver mobile lab equipment.

Vaccination teams continue to make headway in the area, and the WHO said 6,830 people have been immunized in 44 defined vaccination rings and in 10 rings of health workers.

Treatment facilities expand

Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) are fully operating in Beni and Mangina by the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Doctors Without Borders (MSF).

Over the next 2 weeks, ALIMA plans on expanding its ""treatment cube"" capacity. The treatment cubes, developed in the wake of West Africa's massive Ebola outbreak with input from an expert team brought together by ALIMA, have transparent walls that allow health workers to perform most patient care activities without having to wear personal protective equipment (PPE). The units are designed for quick assembly and to offer biosafety level 4 security

In another development, a new ETC in Ituri province staffed by the International Medical Corps is expected to begin operating the week of Sep 9.

MSF said in an update today that in its first month of responding to the DRC's latest Ebola outbreak it has treated 65 patients, more than 80% of the number of confirmed patients hospitalized in the region's ETCs.

Of those treated in MSF's Mangina ETC, 29 have recovered and returned to their families and 3 are still in treatment.

MSF warns epidemic at a crucial point

Berangere Guais, MSF's emergency coordinator in Beni, said the latest epidemic is at a crucial point.

""Yes the number of patients in the treatment center has reduced significantly, but new cases from a number of different chains of transmission have emerged in recent days,"" she said.

Response teams must continue to build trust with the community to ensure that those with symptoms are quickly isolated and tested. ""We just cannot let down our guard until the epidemic is declared over.""

World Health Organization (WHO) officials have said Beni, where community resistance has been reported in some areas, is an emerging hot spot in the DRC's latest outbreak, and the newly identified case from Butembo comes less than a week after the first case was found in the city, a commercial and transportation hub that has a population of about 1 million people.

Butembo patient fled from Ituri

The two new cases in Beni were noted in the health ministry's report for Sep 8, which also noted another death in an earlier confirmed Ebola patient from Beni.

In today's report, the health ministry said the newly confirmed case in Butembo involves a man who got sick in August and was admitted to a health center in Ituri province. He refused transfer to the Mangina Ebola treatment center, however, and fled to Butembo, where his illness progressed.

His blood samples were negative for the virus, but his sperm sample was positive.

During his recovery, his wife visited him, later got sick, and was confirmed as positive for Ebola. Her illnesses is among the confirmed cases from Mandima in Ituri province.

Also in today's report, the health ministry reported another death in an earlier confirmed case form Beni.

The new developments lift the overall outbreak total to 132 cases, including 101 confirmed and 31 probable. So far, 91 deaths have been reported, and health officials are still investigating 9 suspected cases.

Vaccination teams continue to make steady progress with administering the VSV-EBOV vaccine, and 7,780 people have now been immunized.

Experts reassess investigational drugs

A group of WHO experts met on Aug 27 for the second time to update the ethical framework for assessing investigational drugs that could be used in the DRC's Ebola outbreak, and the WHO today released notes covering the consultation, which covered new information that's become available since the experts' first meeting.

In May, the group first assessed five potential treatments that were being considered for an DRC's outbreak in Equateur province that was ongoing at the time.

The report covers the same five drugs: Zmapp, remdesivir, REGN3470-3471-3479, favipiravir, and mAB114. Efforts are under way to develop protocols to rapidly establish randomized controlled trials, which the experts say are the best way to identify therapies that help Ebola patients.

The highest quality data support the use of ZMapp, and benefits outweigh the risks, the group notes. Data also supports the use of remdesivir, an antiviral drug, but clinical trials are needed to weigh the risks and benefits.

For REGN3470-3471-3479, a monoclonal antibody cocktail, data are promising and support the drug's use as another possible option the scientists note.

Though the monoclonal antibody mAb114 is already being used in the current DRC outbreak, concerted efforts are needed to study its risks and benefits, the experts concluded. So far, a few patients have received the drug in the DRC's outbreak and no toxicities have been reported in Ebola patients or clinical study subjects.

It's not clear if favipiravir is helpful, but it's important to do clinical trials to assess if it's beneficial REGN3470-3471-3479 or mAb114 aren't available, the experts said.

The team also discussed the use of combined investigational therapies and learned that a non-human primate study is planned to test the combinations.

Sep 10 WHO treatment page",no result found,no result found,"* 90 killed since outbreak started in July

* First confirmed death recorded in key trading hub last week

* Logistical challenges hamper disease control efforts

By Fiston Mahamba

BENI, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sept 10 (Reuters) - When Esperance Nzavaki heard she was cured of Ebola after three weeks of cutting-edge care at a medical centre in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, she raised her arms to the sky with joy and praised the Lord.

Her recovery is testament to the effectiveness of a new treatment, which isolates patients in futuristic cube-shaped mobile units with transparent walls and gloved access, so health workers no longer need to don cumbersome protective gear.

“I started to feel sick, with a fever and pain all over my body. I thought it was typhoid. I took medicine but it didn’t work,” Nzavaki told Reuters in Beni, a city of several hundred thousand, where officials are racing to contain the virus.

“Then an ambulance came and brought me to hospital for Ebola treatment. Now I praise God I’m healed.”

The fight against Ebola has advanced more in recent years than in any since it was discovered near Congo’s eponymous river in 1976. When the worst outbreak killed 11,300 people in West Africa in 2013-2016, there was no vaccine and treatment amounted to little more than keeping patients comfortable and hydrated.

Now there’s an experimental vaccine manufactured by Merck which this year helped quash this strain of the virus on the other side of the country in under three months, while three experimental treatments have been rolled out for the first time.

Yet even the smartest science can do little about the marauding rebel groups and widespread fear and mistrust that could yet scupper efforts to contain Congo’s tenth outbreak of the deadly haemorrhagic fever. It is so far believed to have killed 90 people since July and infected another 40.

The stakes are high, not just for health reasons: Ebola could complicate the holding of a Dec. 23 election to replace President Joseph Kabila that is already two years late, and would be Congo’s first democratic change of power.

REBELLION, FEAR, MISTRUST

The affected North Kivu and Ituri provinces have been a tinder box of armed rebellion and ethnic killing since two bloody civil wars in the late 1990s. Some areas near the epicentre require armed escorts to reach because of insecurity. Two South African peacekeepers there were wounded in a rebel ambush last week.

And last week, authorities confirmed the first death from Ebola in the major trading hub of Butembo, a city of almost a million near the border with Uganda, dampening hopes that the virus was being brought under control.

Insecurity aside, the biggest challenges the government faces could be panic and downright denial, as they were during the catastrophic West Africa outbreak.

“Ebola does not exist in Beni,” resident Tresor Malala said, shaking his head. “For a long time, people got sick with fever, diarrhoea, vomiting and they healed. Now someone gets a fever, they get sent to the Ebola treatment centre and then they die.”

Taxi driver Mosaste Kala was equally sceptical: “The only people dying are the ones going to the ... treatment centre.”

Tackling these perceptions will be crucial if authorities are to halt the epidemic.

At a news conference on Saturday, Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga admitted that “community resistance is the first challenge to the response to the epidemic”.

In the district of Ndindi, in Beni, Ebola is spreading due to the community’s reluctance to cooperate with health workers, the ministry says. Some locals have hidden sick relatives or refused to be vaccinated.

The problem, says school teacher Alain Mulonda, many of whose pupils were being kept at home by anxious parents, is that locals have little understanding of Ebola.

“If the population of Beni continues to show this distrust,” he said, “this disease will consume the whole town.” (Additional reporting by Amedee Mwarabu in Kinshasa and Aaron Ross in Dakar Writing by Alessandra Prentice Editing by Tim Cocks and David Evans)",no result found

In a related development, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in an update yesterday that a lot of progress has been made in 6 weeks, and cases and deaths in the past week declined significantly. It added, however, that community resistance, weak infection prevention and control practices in health centers, and risk of virus spreading to insecure areas are still major threats.

Some areas have stabilized, but the WHO said Beni is the new hot spot, and response activities are scaling up to ease the impact of potential clusters in Butembo and in Masereka health zone, the latest new areas to report cases. ""The coming few days will be critical in determining the trajectory of the outbreak,"" the agency said.

Latest cases makes 4 in Butembo

The newly reported cases include two from Mabalako, one from Beni, and two from Butembo, lifting the outbreak total to 137, including 106 confirmed and 31 probable cases. Fatal cases held steady at 92.

Butembo, North Kivu province's second-largest city and home to nearly 1 million people, now has four confirmed cases. Earlier cases include a patient who fled from the Beni outbreak hot spot and a man who fled from Ituri province and whose illness was diagnosed retroactively in Butembo based on a semen sample.

The newly reported illness in a healthcare worker means that 18 have now been sickened in the DRC's latest outbreak. Healthcare worker infections are a concern, not only because they are a key part of the frontline response, but also because their illnesses are known to amplify Ebola outbreaks.

The health ministry said officials are investigating 17 suspected cases and that the number of people immunized with VSV-EBOV, Merck's Ebola vaccine, is at 8,738, which includes 544 in Butembo and 220 in Masereka, a health zone not far from Butembo.

Butembo response scale-up

In its weekly update, the WHO said surveillance activities have been extended to Butembo and Masereka.

In Butembo, an operations hub has been opened as a base for outbreak response coordinators, and an emergency operations center is expected to begin operating within the coming days. Also, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and the health ministry are building a 10-bed Ebola treatment center in Butembo, which is expected to begin operating by the end of the week.

Regarding experimental treatments, 29 patients have received investigational drugs, including 14 who received mAb114, 9 who got the antiviral drug remdesivir, and 6 who received Zmapp. The WHO noted that so far 43 vaccination rings have been identified, plus 13 rings of healthcare and other frontline workers.

14-Sep-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

Six weeks into the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the overall situation has improved since the height of the epidemic; however, significant risks remain surrounding the continued detections of sporadic cases within Mabalako, Beni and Butembo health zones in North Kivu Province. While the majority of communities have welcomed response measures, such as daily contact monitoring and vaccination where appropriate, in some, risks of transmission and poor disease outcomes have been amplified by unfavourable behaviours, with reluctance to adopt prevention and risk mitigation behaviours. There have been challenges with contact tracing activities due to the constant movement of people between health zones, individuals hiding when symptoms develop and reports of community resistance. Risks are heightened by continued transmission in local health facilities because of poor infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, sporadic reports of unsafe burials, and the detection of cases in hard-to-reach and insecure areas.

Since the last Disease Outbreak News (data as of 5 September), eight new EVD cases, all of which are confirmed, have been reported: three from Beni, three from Butembo and two from Mabalako health zones. All eight new cases have been directly linked to an, ongoing transmission chain stemming from a community in Beni.

Of the three new cases in Butembo, one was an adult male from Mangina who reported an earlier illness and then was laboratory confirmed post-recovery via testing of a semen sample when his spouse was diagnosed with EVD. Given that he was asymptomatic since travelling to Butembo, the risk of onward transmission from this individual is minimal. The other two cases were health workers who cared for a subsequently-confirmed case (reported in the last Disease Outbreak News) at a small health post and assisted in her transfer to a tertiary hospital. This brings the total to 19 reported cases among health workers: 18 were laboratory confirmed and three have died. All 19 exposures occurred in local health facilities outside of dedicated Ebola treatment centres (ETCs).

As of 12 September 2018, a total of 137 EVD cases (106 confirmed and 31 probable), including 92 deaths (61 confirmed and 31 probable)1 have been reported in seven health zones in North Kivu Province (Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Mabalako, Masereka, Musienene and Oicha), and Mandima Health Zone in Ituri Province (Figure 1). An overall decreasing trend in weekly case incidence continues (Figure 2); however, these trends must be interpreted with caution given the expected delays in case reporting and the ongoing detection of sporadic cases. Of the 130 probable and confirmed cases for whom age and sex information is known, adults aged 35–44 years (22%) and females (57%) accounted for the greatest proportion of cases (Figure 3).

Alerts for suspected viral haemorrhagic fever cases in the outbreak-affected areas, other provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries continue to be closely monitored and rapidly investigated. In the outbreak-affected areas, 15–31 new alerts were reported each day during the past week, of which 4–16 alerts were verified as new suspected cases requiring further investigation and testing. As of 12 September, 17 suspected cases are currently pending testing to confirm or exclude EVD. Moreover, EVD was ruled out for recent alerts from Kasaji, Tanganyika, Tshopo and Kinshasa provinces, as well as for all alerts from neighbouring countries.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, safe and dignified burials, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces. WHO and partners are also conducting preparedness activities in neighbouring countries.

As of 13 September, 190 experts are deployed by WHO to support response activities including emergency coordinators, epidemiologists, laboratory experts, logisticians, clinical care specialists, communicators, and community engagement specialists.

Over 5500 contacts have been registered to date, of which 1751 remain under surveillance as of 12 September 1 . Of these, 75–92% were followed-up daily during the past week. A dip in contact tracing performance rates observed earlier in the week was partly attributed to delays and challenges in establishing contact tracing teams around recent cases in Butembo and Masereka health zones. Response teams are working to address these challenges and improvements in the proportion of contacts successfully reached have been observed in recent days. Strategies are being reviewed to ensure those at high risk of disease are prioritized, rapidly detected, isolated and admitted for treatment if symptoms develop.

Strategies are being reviewed to ensure those at high risk of disease are prioritized, rapidly detected, isolated and admitted for treatment if symptoms develop. As of 13 September, 52 vaccination rings have been defined, in addition to 17 rings of health workers and other frontline workers. These rings include the contacts (and their contacts) of 55 confirmed cases from the last three weeks. To date, 8902 people consented and were vaccinated, including 2951 health care or frontline workers, and 2054 children.

To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of, multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. The includes the UN secretariat, sister Agencies, including International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), multiple Clusters, and peacekeeping operations; World Bank and regional development banks; African Union, and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and regional agencies; Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), Steering Committee, technical networks and operational partners, and the Emergency Medical Team Initiative. GOARN partners continue to support the response through deployment for response, and readiness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries.

ETCs are fully operational in Beni and Mangina with support from The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), respectively. MSF Switzerland and the MoH are building a 10-bed ETC in Butembo, which is expected to be operational by 15 September and will replace the current transit centre. In Beni, ALIMA is planning to expand treatment capacity over the next two weeks. A 20-bed ETC is being constructed in Makeke in Ituri Province with the support of International Medical Corps (IMC), which is expected to be operational during the week of 17 September. A MSF transit centre is already operational in Makeke. Samaritan's Purse continues to support the isolation unit in Bunia.

ETCs continue to provide therapeutics under the monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions (MEURI) protocol in collaboration with the MoH and the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB). WHO is providing technical clinical expertise onsite and is assisting with the creation of a data safety management board.

The MoH, WHO, UNICEF, Red Cross and partners are intensifying activities to engage with local communities in Beni, Butembo and Mangina. Local leaders, religious leaders, opinion leaders, and community networks such as youth groups and motorbike taxi drivers are being engaged on a daily basis to support community outreach for Ebola prevention and early care seeking through active dialogues on radio and interpersonal communication. Community feedback is being systematically collected and their concerns are being addressed. Local frontline community outreach workers are working closely with Ebola response teams to strengthen community engagement and psychosocial support in contact tracing, patient care and safe and dignified burials (SDBs). The current focus is to intensify activities aimed at addressing community concerns through direct partnership with community members.

The Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with support from the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), are coordinating SDB. As of 12 September, Red Cross has established three operational bases in Beni, Mangina and Butembo; in total, 10 SDB teams are operational. To date, 124 SDBs are reported to have been successfully conducted. Red Cross has supported the training of civil protection SDB teams to ensure operational capacity in hard-to-reach areas.

Health screening has been established at 37 Points of Entry (PoE) and more than three million travellers have been screened at these PoE.





WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri continues to hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public health risk was assessed to be high at the national and regional levels, and low globally.

As the risk of national and regional spread remains high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure health authorities are alerted and are operationally ready to respond.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no countries have implemented any travel restriction to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Tests have confirmed Ebola in three more people, all from the hot spot in Beni, the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) health ministry said today.

The latest cases lift the outbreak total to 140, which includes 109 confirmed and 31 probable cases. Two more deaths were reported, putting the fatality number at 94, and health officials are still investigating 13 suspected cases. So far, 8,963 people have been vaccinated with VSV-EBOV, Merck's experimental Ebola vaccine.

Also today, the World Health Organization (WHO) posted an update on the outbreak, which said that, at the 6-week mark, the overall situation has improved, but there are still significant risks owing to sporadic cases that continue to be reported in Mabalako, Beni, and Butembo health zones.

The WHO's report also noted ongoing challenges with community resistance. It said though most communities have welcomed response activities such as contact monitoring and vaccination, in some locations behaviors are increasing the risk of transmission and leading to poor disease outcomes. Such behaviors include constant movement between health zones, hiding when symptoms develop, and other types of community resistance.

""Risks are heightened by continued transmission in local health facilities because of poor infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, sporadic reports of unsafe burials, and the detection of cases in hard-to-reach and insecure areas,"" the WHO said.

Since its last similar report on Sep 5, eight new cases were reported to the WHO, all linked to an ongoing transmission chain from a community in Beni. Three of the patients were diagnosed in Beni health zone, 3 in Butembo, and 2 in Mabalako.

New polio cases in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Somalia

In its latest weekly update, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) reported new polio cases in four countries, including wild poliovirus 1 (WPV1) in Afghanistan and Pakistan and vaccine-derived polio in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Somalia.

Afghanistan's latest case involves a patient from Uruzgan province who had a Jul 8 paralysis onset, bringing the country's total for 2018 to 13 WPV1 cases. Pakistan's new case-patient is from Charsada province and had a paralysis onset of Aug 1, lifting the country's total to 4 for the year.

Elsewhere, PNG reported three new cases in its outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1). Two patients are from Eastern Highlands province and had paralysis onsets on Jul 24 and Jul 27, and one is from National capital district and had an Aug 2 onset. The country has now reported 12 cVDPV1 cases in its outbreak. A nationwide vaccine campaign is planned for October and November.

Somalia, which is experiencing separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3, reported two new cVDPV2 cases, both in the same district in Lower Juba province. Paralysis onsets were Jul 29 and Jul 30. For 2018, the country has now recorded 4 cVDPV2 cases, 2 cVDPV3 cases, and 1 involving both types.

Surveillance tests find low-path H7N3 avian flu on California turkey farm

Pre-slaughter testing recently revealed low-pathogenic H7N3 avian flu in a California turkey flock, according to a Sep 12 notification from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The report said the last detection of the virus occurred in April.

The birds at the farm in Stanislaus County, located in California's Central Valley, didn't show any symptoms and tested positive for the virus on Sep 6. All 26,258 turkeys on the farm were destroyed to control the spread of the virus.

Partial genetic sequencing showed that the H7 and N3 are from low-pathogenic North American wild bird lineages. More detailed characterization will be done pending virus recovery.

According to the report, the US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the California Department of Food and Agriculture are conducting an epidemiologic investigation and have increased testing following the detection of the virus, including 10 commercial poultry farms in a 10-kilometer zone around the affected farm.

Sep 12 OIE report on low-path H7N3 in California

In related news, earlier this week, Denmark reported more detections of highly pathogenic H5N6 in wild birds. The Sep 11 OIE report said pairs of mallards and pheasants were found dead on Aug 27 in the town of Slagelse on the island of Zealand, and a mute swan and common eider were found dead on Sep 3 in the harbor town of Orehoved on the island of Falster.

The country has reported a few other detections of H5N6 in wild birds since July. The H5N6 strain in European birds is not the same as zoonotic H5N6 reported in Asia.

Canadian officials note 419 Salmonella cases tied to frozen breaded chicken

In the 16 months since the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to help identify outbreaks, it has confirmed 419 Salmonella cases involving frozen raw breaded chicken products in 12 separate outbreaks, and 2 of the outbreaks are likely still ongoing, the agency said yesterday in a public health notice.

Of the 419 patients, 86 required hospitalization. Three patients died, but for two of them Salmonella infection was not the cause of death and for the third the role of the infection as a cause of death could not be determined. Ontario had the most cases (146), followed by Quebec (98) and Alberta (60). PHAC scientists began using WGS in May 2017.

PHAC alerted the public to both ongoing outbreaks on Jul 21. One involves 39 cases in 7 provinces and the other 25 cases in 8 provinces. The first outbreak is linked to No Name brand chicken nuggets, whose products were recalled on Jul 20. The other outbreak is tied to unbranded $10 chicken fries. Both products are made by Loblaw Companies Ltd of Brampton, Ont.

In a separate statement on the risk of the products, PHAC said, ""Most frozen breaded chicken products available for sale in grocery stores in Canada contain raw chicken that can cause Salmonella illness and therefore pose an increased health risk to Canadians who handle, prepare or consume them. Such products include chicken nuggets, chicken strips, chicken burgers, popcorn chicken and chicken fries. Canadians need to be aware that even though these products may appear to be cooked, they are not. They need to be handled carefully and cooked properly to an internal temperature of at least 74°C (165°F) before they are safe to eat.""

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has posted seven food recalls related to the 12 outbreaks dating back to July 2017.

The outbreak, on the eastern border of the DRC, increased by 2 infections and now stands at 142 cases (111 confirmed, 31 probable), according to officials. Of the 142 total number of patients, 97 have died, the DRC Ministry of Health (MOH) said in yesterday's update.

The two new cases came from Beni and Butembo, and all three deaths occurred in Beni, which has been one of the epicenters of virus activity.

On Sep 15, the MOH traveled throughout Beni in a caravan to raise awareness about Ebola. The caravan made several stops at busy places in the city, and a broadcast of the visit will be played on the radio.

Officials also said they are investigating possible case contacts in the Komanda health zone, north of Beni city, after a confirmed Ebola patient died at an Ebola treatment center in Beni.

""The purpose of the mission is to identify contacts and define vaccination belts,"" the MOH said. The MOH denied rumors that Ebola has been identified in Kabalo and that four suspected case-patients were hospitalized at the General Reference Hospital of Kalemie.

Outbreak slows but doesn't stop

In a Sep 14 statement on the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, as the outbreak turns 6 weeks old, transmission has slowed, but, ""significant risks remain surrounding the continued detections of sporadic cases within Mabalako, Beni, and Butembo health zones in North Kivu Province.""

The problem, the WHO said, is the location of the outbreak, which is one of the DRC's most insecure regions, full of both refugees and militia members.

""There have been challenges with contact tracing activities due to the constant movement of people between health zones, individuals hiding when symptoms develop and reports of community resistance,"" the WHO said. ""Risks are heightened by continued transmission in local health facilities because of poor infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, sporadic reports of unsafe burials, and the detection of cases in hard-to-reach and insecure areas.""

The WHO updated the number of infected healthcare workers, reporting a total of 19 as of Sep 12. All but one of those cases was lab-confirmed, and three workers have died. According to the WHO, all 19 exposures occurred in local health facilities outside of dedicated Ebola treatment centers.

More than 5,500 contacts have been registered to date, the WHO said, and 52 vaccination rings have been defined, in addition to 17 rings of health workers and other frontline workers.

""These rings include the contacts (and their contacts) of 55 confirmed cases from the last three weeks. To date, 8,902 people consented and were vaccinated, including 2,951 health care or frontline workers, and 2,054 children,"" the WHO said.

DRC officials said they are updating the number of people vaccinated in response to the oubreak.

As the number of Ebola cases and deaths held steady in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) over the last 2 days, the number of people vaccinated passed the 10,000 mark.

Peter Salama, MD, director-general of emergency preparedness with the World Health Organization (WHO), said on Twitter yesterday that the country topped the 10,000-vaccinee mark on Sep 17 and noted that officials are focusing on individual families and communities where there is less acceptance to answer questions and explain more about the intervention.

Meanwhile, the DRC health ministry today said no new Ebola cases or deaths have been reported over the past 2 days, though health officials are investigating 6 suspected cases. The outbreak total remains at 142 cases, 111 of them confirmed and 31 listed as probable. The number of deaths held steady at 97.

In a related development, the WHO yesterday posted a weekly situation report that detailed disease activity and response actions. It said officials have made a lot of progress in limiting the spread of Ebola to new areas in the more than 6 weeks since the outbreak was declared. It added that the situation in Mangina in the Mabalako health zone has stabilized and that Beni has become the new hot spot, with most new cases occurring there or related to a Beni transmission chain. ""Teams must continue to enhance response activities to mitigate potential clusters in the city of Butembo and Masereka Health Zone,"" the agency said.

The WHO added that there are still significant threats of further spread, including contacts lost to follow-up, delayed recognition of Ebola illness in health centers, poor infection control in health centers, and patients leaving health centers and refusing transfer to Ebola treatment centers.

Since the last WHO report, 6 more patients received experimental treatment, raising the total to 35. They include 19 who received mAb115, 9 who got the antiviral drug remdesivir, and 7 who were treated with ZMapp. Of the treated patients, 16 were discharged, 11 are still receiving care, and 8 died. The WHO said all of the deaths occurred in patients who had advanced disease, including organ failure, upon admission.

Smallpox vaccine sent to UK after monkeypox cases

Healthcare workers who treated Britain's first monkeypox patients earlier this month will now be vaccinated with Imvanex smallpox vaccine in an effort to prevent further spread of the virus. Though the vaccine, manufactured by Bavarian Nordic, is not approved for use in monkeypox outbreaks, smallpox vaccines have previously proved efficacious in preventing monkeypox, the company said in a news release today.

Two people were diagnosed as having monkeypox in the past 2 weeks in the United Kingdom. The cases appear unrelated, but Public Health England (PHE) said both patients recently traveled to Nigeria, where monkeypox infection is more common.

""We are pleased to assist the PHE in this emergency situation, which has required the prompt action from all involved parties, and I am happy that we have been able to respond with such short notice,"" said Paul Chaplin, president and CEO of Bavarian Nordic.

Monkeypox is not easily transmitted among humans. It is also much less deadly than smallpox, with an estimated fatality rate of 1% to 10%, the company said.

WHO: 6.3 million deaths in children in 2017, with most preventable

In estimates of childhood mortality for 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners said 6.3 million kids younger than 15 died, or 1 every 5 seconds. Most of the fatalities were from preventable causes, including infectious diseases, according to the report, which also included the involvement of UNICEF, the United Nations Population Division, and the World Bank Group.

The youngest children were hardest hit, with the vast majority of fatalities—5.4 million—occurring in the first 5 years of life and newborns accounting for half of the deaths.

Laurence Chandy, UNICEF's director of data, research, and policy, said in a WHO statement that although health officials have made remarkable progress toward saving children's lives since 1990, ""Millions are still dying because of who they are and where they are born. With simple solutions like medicines, clean water, electricity, and vaccines, we can change that reality for every child."" He added that without urgent action, 56 million children under 5 will die from now until 2030, half of them newborns.

Kids and under age 5 in sub-Saharan Africa bore an especially high fatality burden, accounting for half of all deaths in the youngest children. Another 30% were from Southern Asia. The WHO said that in sub-Saharan Africa 1 in 13 children die before they turn 5, compared with 1 in 185 in high-income countries. In general, mortality rates were higher in rural areas than in urban areas and in children with uneducated mothers compared with moms who had secondary or higher education.

The most common treatable causes in children under 5 were complications during birth, pneumonia, diarrhea, neonatal sepsis, and malaria. In the next older age-group, injuries, especially from drowning and road traffic, become more common.

Flu levels still elevated as Southern Hemisphere nears end of season

Influenza activity remained elevated in South America, while it appeared to decrease in southern Africa, according to the latest global flu update from the WHO.

South American countries still, however, reported flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity, most notably influenza 2009 H1N1 circulation.

Australia and New Zealand reported low seasonal levels of flu, and most of the temperate zone in the Northern Hemisphere reported typical inter-seasonal levels. In the Caribbean and Central America, influenza detections remained low.

Flu appears to have peaked in most Asian regions, with some detections in Cambodia and the Philippines.

Of lab-tested samples collected from Aug 20 to Sep 2, the WHO said 82.6% were typed as influenza A and 17.4% as influenza B. Of subtyped influenza A viruses, 64.9% were H1N1 and 35.1% were influenza A(H3N2).

20-Sep-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains active. While substantial progress has been made to limit the spread of the disease to new areas and the situation in Mangina (Mabalako Health Zone) is stabilizing, the cities of Beni and Butembo have become the new hotspot. Response teams continue to enhance activities to mitigate potential clusters in these cities and prevent spread to other areas.

Significant risks for further spread of the disease remain. Continued challenges include contacts lost to follow-up, delayed recognition of EVD in health centres, poor infection prevention and control (IPC) in health centres, and reluctance among some cases to be treatment in Ebola treatment centres (ETCs). While the majority of communities have welcomed response measures, in some, risks of transmission and poor disease outcomes have been amplified by unfavourable behaviours, with reluctance to adopt prevention and risk mitigation strategies. The priority remains strengthening all components of the public health response in all affected areas, as well as continuing to enhance operational readiness and preparedness in the non-affected provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring countries.

Since the last Disease Outbreak News (data as of 12 September), five new confirmed EVD cases were reported: four from Beni and one from Butembo health zones. All have been linked to ongoing transmission chains within these respective communities.

As of 18 September 2018, a total of 142 EVD cases (111 confirmed and 31 probable), including 97 deaths (66 confirmed and 31 probable)1 have been reported in seven health zones in North Kivu Province (Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Mabalako, Masereka, Musienene and Oicha), and Mandima Health Zone in Ituri Province (Figure 1). An overall decreasing trend in weekly case incidence continues (Figure 2); however, these trends must be interpreted with caution given the expected delays in case reporting and the ongoing detection of sporadic cases. Of the 135 probable and confirmed cases for whom age and sex information is known, adults aged 35–44 years (23%) and females (56%) accounted for the greatest proportion of cases (Figure 3). Cumulatively, 19 (18 confirmed and one probable) health workers have been affected to date, three of whom have died.

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to closely monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries. As of 18 September 2018, nine suspected cases are awaiting laboratory testing. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as in neighbouring countries; and to date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts from neighbouring provinces and countries.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC measures, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

As of 18 September, 209 experts have been deployed by WHO to support response activities including emergency coordinators, epidemiologists, laboratory experts, logisticians, clinical care specialists, communicators, and community engagement specialists.

Over 5000 contacts have been registered to date, of which 1983 remain under surveillance as of 18 September 2 . Of these, 90-95% were followed-up daily during the past week.

. Of these, 90-95% were followed-up daily during the past week. As of 19 September, 58 vaccination rings have been defined, in addition to 24 rings of health workers and other frontline workers. These rings include the contacts (and their contacts) of all confirmed cases from the last four weeks. To date, 10 701 people consented and were vaccinated, including 4008 health care or frontline workers, and 2362 children. The ring vaccination teams are currently active in three health areas in North Kivu and one in Ituri.

ETCs remain fully operational in Beni and Mangina with support from The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), respectively. MSF Switzerland and the MoH are supporting a temporary treatment center in Butembo where a fully functional ETC will open soon. The Makeke ETC in Ituri Province, which is supported by International Medical Corps (IMC), was inaugurated on 18 September. Samaritan's Purse continues to support IPC activities in Bunia.

ETCs continue to provide therapeutic agents under the monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions (MEURI) protocol in collaboration with the MoH and the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB). WHO is providing technical clinical expertise and mentoring onsite.

WASH and IPC activities are ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and are supported by a number of partners in the field. Numerous activities have occurred in health facilities in the affected areas which include facility assessments, decontamination of centres, establishment of triage areas, and training on standard precautions as well as Ebola-specific IPC measures, which include personal protective equipment donning and doffing.

The MoH, WHO, UNICEF, Red Cross and partners are intensifying activities to engage with local communities in the affected areas. Local leaders, religious leaders, opinion leaders, and community networks such as youth groups, women’s group and motorbike taxi drivers are being engaged on a daily basis to support community outreach for Ebola prevention and early care seeking through active dialogues on radio, community gatherings and house-to-house visits. Community feedback is being systematically collected and concerns are being addressed. Local frontline community outreach workers are working closely with Ebola response teams to strengthen community engagement and psychosocial support in contact tracing, patient care, SDBs and vaccination of close contacts. The current focus is to intensify activities aimed at addressing community concerns through direct partnership with community members.

Expert teams have deployed to six at-risk provinces (Bas Uele, Haut Uele, Ituri, Maniema, South Kivu and Tanganika) to facilitate implementation of priority readiness actions, including strengthening multisectoral coordination, surveillance for early detection, laboratory diagnostic capacity, points of entry (PoE) surveillance, rapid response teams, risk communication, social mobilization and community engagement, case management and IPC capacities, operations support, and logistics.

As of 17 September, health screening has been established at 43 PoEs and close to four million travellers have been screened at these PoEs.

To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of, multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. This includes the UN secretariat, sister Agencies, including International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), multiple Clusters, and peacekeeping operations; World Bank and regional development banks; African Union, and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and regional agencies; Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), Steering Committee, technical networks and operational partners, and the Emergency Medical Team Initiative. GOARN partners continue to support the response through deployment for response, and readiness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries.

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri continues to hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public health risk was assessed to be high at the national and regional levels, and low globally.

As the risk of national and regional spread remains high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure health authorities are alerted and are operationally ready to respond.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no countries have implemented any travel restriction to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Uganda will vaccinate against Ebola should it spread from Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been hit twice this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday.

Uganda borders Congo’s Ituri and North Kivu provinces, where Ebola is believed to have killed 97 people since the latest outbreak started in July, and infected another 45.

A death from Ebola was recorded this month in the Congolese city of Butembo , which is a hub for Congolese mineral exports and imports from East African ports via Uganda.

In a statement on Thursday, the WHO said it was assisting Uganda, which has remained clear of Ebola so far this year, to set up the “ring vaccination” strategy being used in Congo.

Under the strategy, every contact of an Ebola case including health workers and family members is traced and vaccinated.

“The opportunity that vaccinating frontline health workers and ring vaccination provides to contain the disease (...) is one that must never be missed. That’s why we are making all these costly but necessary preparations”, WHO’s Uganda Representative Yonas Tegegn Woldermariam said in the statement.

Uganda has identified spaces to store the vaccine and installed equipment to ensure it can be transported nationwide.

Uganda has had five outbreaks since 2000, the latest in 2017. The contagious disease causes hemorrhagic fever, vomiting and diarrhea. Ebola killed 11,300 in West Africa in 2013-2016, though treatment during that outbreak was less advanced.

The experimental vaccine, manufactured by Merck, was first deployed to the Congo this year. It is designed to target the Zaire strain of the virus, which was confirmed to have caused Congo’s current outbreak.",no result found

According to Reuters, the case was reported in Tchomia, on the shores of Lake Albert, the closest the disease has come to Uganda during the outbreak. Tchomia is in Djugu territory, where violent ethnic clashes have caused mass migration across the Ugandan border.

Yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that no cases of Ebola have been detected in Uganda, despite more than 100 investigations of suspicious illnesses. But Uganda, with help from the WHO, is preparing to implement a ring vaccination strategy in the coming months in an effort to protect healthcare workers. About 3,000 doses of Merck's Ebola vaccine will be shipped in cold-chain compartments to Uganda, the WHO said in a news release.

""Ebola is a very aggressive and deadly disease. The opportunity that vaccinating frontline health workers and ring vaccination provides to contain the disease as soon as it is confirmed when the cause is Ebola Zaire in a country is one that must never be missed. That's why we are making all these costly but necessary preparations,"" said Yonas Tegegn Woldermariam, MD, WHO representative in Uganda.

The WHO said there are 22 high-risk border districts between DRC and Uganda, and ministry of health officials in each country have increased cross-border surveillance.

New case in Butembo

Yesterday DRC's ministry of health announced the eighth confirmed case of Ebola in Butembo, a large city in the eastern part of the country. The new case brings the total number of cases to 143 (112 confirmed), including 97 deaths.

Butembo, along with Beni, have become the new hot spots for disease activity, according to the latest WHO outbreak update.

""The situation in Mangina (Mabalako Health Zone) is stabilizing,"" the WHO said. Since Sep 12, all five new Ebola cases detected have been from active transmission chains in Butembo and Beni.

The DRC confirmed that 10,663 people have been vaccinated against Ebola, including 3,935 in Mabalako, 3,409 in Beni, 1,582 in Mandima, 814 in Butembo, 373 in Katwa, 270 in Masereka, 121 in Oicha, 94 in Komanda and 65 in Kinshasa, since vaccination began on Aug 8. The outbreak began on Aug 1 in Mangina. The WHO said 4,008 health workers and 2,362 children are included in the total vaccinated.

As of Sep 18, the WHO said nine suspected cases are awaiting laboratory testing. Currently, 8 vaccination rings have been identified, in addition to 24 rings of health workers and other frontline workers. These rings include the contacts (and their contacts) of all confirmed cases from the last 4 weeks, the WHO said.

""Significant risks for further spread of the disease remain,"" the WHO said. ""Continued challenges include contacts lost to follow-up, delayed recognition of EVD in health centres, poor infection prevention and control (IPC) in health centres, and reluctance among some cases to be treatment in Ebola treatment centres.""

Adults ages 35 to 44 account for 23% of cases in this outbreak (based on information from 135 patients. Most cases (56%) have been in women. Nineteen healthcare workers have been infected, three of whom have died.

The continued challenge is the turbulent location of the outbreak, health officials said. Some communities have rejected medical assistance and shown reluctance to implement prevention measures.

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo has confirmed a case of Ebola on its border with Uganda, a country so far clear of the deadly virus, authorities in Congo said on Friday.

The new infection is almost 200 km (125 miles) away from the nearest other known case in Congo’s current Ebola outbreak, which is believed to have killed 97 people since July and infected another 46 in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

Ituri province’s Vice Governor Keta Upar said in a statement that the latest Ebola case had been reported in Tchomia on the shores of Lake Albert. It is the closest the disease has come to Uganda, Congo’s eastern neighbor.

Uganda’s health ministry said on Thursday it was preparing to deploy vaccinations against the virus should it spread to its territory.

Congo has experienced 10 outbreaks of Ebola since it was discovered in the country’s forested north in 1976. The disease causes hemorrhagic fever, vomiting and diarrhea and kills about half of the people it infects.

Health officials have made progress slowing the spread of the virus with experimental vaccines and treatments. But violence and turmoil in eastern Congo has made some areas difficult to access.

The latest outbreak of the deadly disease in Democratic Republic of Congo has been focused in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, which have been a tinder box of armed rebellion and ethnic killing since two civil wars in the late 1990s.

Militants believed to belong to the Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan Islamist group active in eastern Congo, clashed with Congolese troops in Beni, a town of several hundred thousand people, local civil society leader Kizito Bin Hangi said by telephone.

“Beni is ungovernable this morning. Several protests have been declared in the town where the people express their anger with consternation,” he said.

In addition to the known fatalities, dozens of civilians were wounded as they fled the violence, which broke out in the early hours of Saturday evening and lasted until midnight, Bin Hangi added.

During a news conference in Beni on Sunday, a representative of the Congolese army said four soldiers had also been killed in the attack.

Spokesman Mak Hazukay confirmed the civilian death toll of 14, but said six civilians and four military personnel had been wounded — lower figures than estimated by the civil society leader.

The attack underscores the challenges the government and health organizations face in tackling Ebola in an area where years of instability has undermined locals’ confidence in the authorities.

Community unrest in the wake of the latest violence prompted the Health Ministry to suspend temporarily the field work it has been carrying out in Beni as part of its Ebola response.

“Many inhabitants of the town of Beni took to the streets this Sunday to protest against the growing insecurity in the zone. The field work of the response will resume once calm returns to the town,” the ministry said in its daily Ebola report.

The violence in Beni on Saturday has killed 21 people, 17 of them civilians, with the DRC's army blaming the Allied Democratic Forces, a rebel militia, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported today. The country's health ministry asked aid groups working in Beni to temporarily suspend their activities, but Doctors Without Borders (MSF) Ebola treatment centers located 20 to 30 miles outside the city were operating normally, the report said.

Problems in Beni, where outbreak responders are already grappling with pockets of community resistance to steps such as contact tracing, vaccination, and medical treatment, come 3 months before an election to replace Joseph Kabila, the DRC's controversial president.

In a statement yesterday, the health ministry said many residents took to the streets to protest growing insecurity in the area, adding that response activities will resume as soon as calm returns to the city.

Ebola death toll hits 100

The 6 new confirmed cases include a case in Tshomia in Ituri province near the Ugandan border that was recently reported by the news media, 4 from Beni, and 1 from Mabalako, according to DRC health ministry updates posted Sep 21, 22, and 23.

Also, the number of deaths reached 100 with the addition of 3 fatalities reported in Beni, Tshomia, and Butembo.

The new cases boost the DRC's Ebola total to 149 cases, 118 of them confirmed. Also, health officials are investigating 12 suspected infections.

Patient flees to unsecured health zone

In another worrisome development, the DRC's health ministry said yesterday that a confirmed case-patient in Beni escaped a hospital before being transferred to an Ebola treatment center. The patient was found in an unsecured part of Kalunguta health zone.

Ebola patient who evade treatment pose a major risk of spread, and the threat of the disease moving to an non-secure area poses an extra threat to responders and adds to the already difficult task of containing the virus.

Discussions are under way with the village chief and the health zone's management team to safety retrieve the patient, the health ministry said.

Tshomia patient tied to resistant district

The Ebola case detected near the Ugandan border, noted earlier media reports, involves a known contact of the first confirmed case in Beni's Ndindi district, which has been a flash point for community resistance against response efforts, the health ministry said in its Sep 21 daily update. The first patient in Ndindi died in the community, and the woman wasn't buried securely.

Some of her relatives refused to cooperate with health responders, which led to several confirmed cases and deaths in the same family. When their symptoms began, they fled to other health areas, including Mabalako, Masereka, Butembo, and Tshomia. ""Thus, all the first confirmed cases in these areas are direct contacts of the case of Ndindi district,"" the health ministry said.

Outbreak coordinators sent teams to all the areas within the first 24 to 36 hours to quickly identify and vaccinate contacts surrounding the patients, the ministry said, adding, ""These rapid interventions are necessary to rapidly break the chain of transmission related to Ndindi's resistance.""

On Sep 21, a joint team that included vaccinators, experts in infection prevention and control, and an emergency physician was deployed to Tshomia health zone, and the next day vaccination of the first contacts of the patient confirmed there began. The ministry said that so far 56 contacts have already voluntarily registered with vaccination teams.

The health ministry said 10 people in Tshomia have been vaccinated, bringing the overall total in the outbreak to 11,417. In its update on Sep 21, the health ministry said 4,320 more doses of the experimental VSV-EBOV vaccine have arrived in Kinshasa.

Sep 21 DRC update

Sep 22 DRC update

Sep 23 DRC update","Aid groups say they have been forced to halt Ebola prevention activities due to violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) restive east over the weekend that killed 21 people.

The bloodshed occurred on Saturday in Beni, a flashpoint city in the North Kivu region. The Congolese army has blamed the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a notorious rebel militia.

The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said it and other aid agencies have been forced to temporarily suspend activities in Beni because of the attack.

""This points to an increasingly worrisome security situation across the country,"" the group said in a statement on Monday, adding that it had to halt activities due to intensifying and frequent clashes in Djugu territory in the northern province of Ituri, and Fizi in South Kivu over the last two weeks.

""These suspensions have disrupted aid to thousands of people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection,"" the NRC statement added.

Stephen Lamin, area manager for NRC, said it was a ""worst-case scenario"". The group provides food, household items, education and legal counselling in the region.

The latest Ebola outbreak in the DRC's east has infected at least 118 people, 69 of whom have died, according to Congo's health ministry.

Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga claimed that health staff had temporarily suspended field activities requiring home visits and that ""all pillars of the response remain fully operational"".

""Despite the unfortunate events of the last few days, the Ministry of Health remains fully committed,"" he said, adding that health centres, including the Beni Ebola Treatment Center, remained open.

Elections threatened

Witnesses said Saturday's violence began in Beni city centre in the late afternoon when attackers began using guns and machetes against people there.

An initial army estimate put the death toll at 18, including four soldiers, but later raised it to 21.

On Monday morning, many shops, schools and businesses in Beni remained closed in protest, while an opposition legislator called for ""a rapid assessment of the army's operational effectiveness"" ahead of the December elections.

""The front line is no longer in the Virunga National Park and is now in Beni, which poses a real danger for the holding of safe elections on December 23,"" said Anselme Mwaka, an opposition MP from the Union for the Congolese Nation.

Since January, Congolese troops have been engaged in a military operation against the ADF, but have not yet managed to stop the bloodshed in and around Beni.

As of yesterday, the ministry of health in the DRC reported 150 confirmed and suspected cases of the hemorrhagic fever, with 9 cases under investigation. The death toll stands at 100, and there is a new case in Tchomia, the small town near Lake Albert and the Ugandan border. That patient was identified as the partner of the case-patient first diagnosed in Tchomia last week.

Tchomia is near the DRC's border with Uganda.

According to the WHO, 39 patients during this outbreak have been treated with experimental Ebola therapies, including mAb 114, remdesivir, and Zmapp. Of these 39 patients, 12 have died.

The DRC said that since immunization campaigns began on Aug 8, 11,563 people have been vaccinated, including 4,065 in Mabalako, 3,652 in Beni, 1,632 in Mandima, 884 in Butembo, 683 in Katwa, 270 in Masereka, 164 in Komanda, 121 in Oicha, 65 in Kinshasa, and 27 in Tchomia.

Attacks threaten response

""Overall the trends in recent weeks have been positive,"" said Salama, explaining that 5 weeks ago, officials were reporting 40 cases of suspected Ebola per week, and now they are seeing 10 per week. ""But that overall trend overlies a series of grave obstacles the response is now facing.”

Salama said that although the DRC response has been excellent, there are three major, interconnected challenges to the response effort: security, level of community resistance and mistrust, and spread to rural areas and the area around the Uganda border.

""We're seeing increased frequency and severity of attacks by armed opposition in recent weeks,"" Salama said. The latest and most deadly attack took place on Sep 22 in Beni, the site of the WHO's base of operations. That attack, carried out by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), resulted in at least 21 deaths, including 17 civilians.

Because of the attack, Beni is undergoing community mourning until Friday, effectively halting the WHO's tracking of suspected cases. Salama said there were at least three newly suspected cases in Beni that couldn’t be investigated until the mourning period ended.

Over the weekend, the health minister of the DRC, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, issued a statement to citizens of Beni, assuring them that response infrastructure was still in place in the aftermath of the attack.

""Do not let these tragic incidents divide us,"" Kalenga said in a letter. ""Let us stand united, and united because, beyond the medical response, the only way to end the Ebola Virus Disease epidemic remains the mobilization and commitment of the community alongside the health authorities.""

Rebels fuel community mistrust

Though most communities have accepted Ebola response efforts, as evidenced by nearly 100% vaccination coverage of case contacts, there are pockets of community reluctance and refusal that have allowed certain transmission chains to continue, Salama said.

""This is the most difficult outbreak we have ever faced, and we are now extremely concerned that several factors could create a perfect storm for further transmission,"" Salama said.

The ADF is just one of several armed groups that have taken to social media to sow seeds of government distrust, blaming health officials for Ebola. But despite the dangerous situation, Salama said the WHO has no current plans to pull out of the region.

Sep 24 DRC update

Sep 22 Kalenga letter",no result found,no result found,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday an Ebola outbreak in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo could worsen rapidly because of attacks by armed groups, community resistance and the geographic spread of the disease.

FILE PHOTO: A medical worker wears a protective suit as he prepares to administer Ebola patient care at The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) treatment center in Beni, North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo September 6, 2018. REUTERS/Fiston Mahamba/File Photo

At least 100 people have died in the outbreak, out of 150 cases in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

“We are now extremely concerned that several factors may be coming together over the next weeks and months to create a potential perfect storm,” the WHO’s head of emergency response, Peter Salama, told a news conference in Geneva.

The response is at a critical juncture and, although the weekly number of new cases has fallen from about 40 to about 10 in the past few weeks and more than 11,700 people have been vaccinated, major obstacles remain ahead, Salama said.

Attacks by armed opposition groups have increased in severity and frequency, especially those attributed to the Alliance of Democratic Forces, most dramatically an attack that killed 21 in the city of Beni, where WHO’s operation is based.

The city has declared a “ville morte”, a period of mourning until at least Friday, obliging WHO to suspend its operations.

Overnight on Monday, unidentified assailants entered the town of Oïcha, about 20 km (12 miles) north of Beni, burned houses, killed one man and kidnapped 14 children and one woman, according to two local officials. Oicha has two confirmed cases of the virus and one probable case.

On Monday 80 percent of Ebola contacts — people at risk of developing the disease and so requiring monitoring — and three suspected cases in and around Beni could not be reached for disease monitoring.

EXPLOITATION

Pockets of “reluctance, refusal and resistance” to accept Ebola vaccination were generating many of the new cases, Salama said.

“We also see a very concerning trend. That resistance, driven by quite natural fear of this terrifying disease, is starting to be exploited by local politicians, and we’re very concerned in the run up to elections, projected for December, that exploitation... will gather momentum and make it very difficult to root out the last cases of Ebola.”

Some people were fleeing into the forest to escape Ebola follow-up treatment and checks, sometimes moving hundreds of kilometers, he said.

There was one such case to the south of Beni, and another to the north, close to the riverbanks of Lake Albert. Both were inaccessible for security reasons.

Neighboring Uganda was now facing an “imminent threat”, and social media posts were conflating Ebola with criticism of the DRC government and the United Nations and “a range of conspiracy theories”, which could put healthworkers at risk.

“We will not yet consider the need to evacuate but we are developing a range of contingency plans to see where our staff are best located,” he said.

“If WHO and its partners had to leave North Kivu ... we would have grave concerns that this outbreak would not be able to be well controlled in the coming weeks or months.”","A health worker in protective gear works at an Ebola treatment center in Beni, Eastern Congo.

WHO warns of ‘perfect storm’ for Ebola in eastern Congo

GENEVA — Insecurity, public defiance about vaccinations and political jockeying could create a “perfect storm” leading Congo’s latest Ebola outbreak to spread, the emergencies chief for the World Health Organization said Tuesday.

Dr. Peter Salama said the response to the deadly hemorrhagic fever is at a “critical juncture” in eastern North Kivu province, where the outbreak was declared nearly two months ago. Health officials have reported 119 confirmed cases, including 69 deaths.

WHO’s operations in Beni, where work to control the outbreak is centered, are “in effect suspended” following a weekend attack by suspected Allied Democratic Forces rebels that killed at least 18 people, Salama said.

It was the seventh attack officials have recorded during the outbreak. The ADF rebels have been able to overrun Congolese military bases and ambush U.N. peacekeeping forces, he said.

Salama said it was unclear when operations might resume but that an official mourning period is expected to last until Friday. There are no plans for WHO or other United Nations staff to pull out, he said.

Overall trends in the Ebola response have been positive, Salama said. But the deadly threat posed by rebel groups, public fears about treatment options in a region facing its first Ebola outbreak and politicians fanning those fears ahead of elections in December have presented challenges.

Such factors “may be coming together over the next weeks to months to create a potential perfect storm,” he said.

He also raised concerns about international spread of Ebola, particularly to nearby Uganda, which was facing an “imminent” threat after a confirmed death near the border last week. Local officials said the woman, who had participated in burials of Ebola victims, had refused a vaccination for the disease and then disappeared.

In other developments, one new Ebola infection was confirmed in Beni, and researchers reported on adverse events following vaccination with VSV-EBOV—which were mild to moderate and of short duration—based on a ring vaccination trial in frontline workers in Guinea's outbreak.

Response pause spreads to Butembo

In an update yesterday, the DRC's health ministry said the civil society had called on Beni residents to observe a 5-day protest over a violent clash on Sep 22 between rebels and armed forces, which killed 21 people and suspended response activities. Several recent cases have resulted from a transmission chain Beni, where health officials have struggled to trace and vaccinate contacts amid pockets of community resistance.

The protest threatened to stall response activities, but yesterday after meeting with the country's response coordinator Beni's mayor met with the civil society president to explain the dangers of stopping the response for a whole week, the health ministry said in its update yesterday. Following the meetings, the civil society president announced that all response teams from both the government and partner organizations could work during the protest days.

Today the ministry said field activities in Beni began cautiously and that teams were able to conduct their work in the community safety.

The agency added, however, that in Butembo, a pressure group called La Veranda Mutsanga declared a multi-day protest to sympathize with the people in Beni, which slowed down field activities in the urban area, where 8 cases have been reported, 6 of them confirmed.

One new case in Beni

The DRC's update yesterday reported one new case, a patient from Beni, raising the outbreak total to 151 cases, 120 of them confirmed. One more death was reported, also involving a resident of Beni.

No new cases were reported today, but the ministry said 17 suspected cases are under investigation.

Vaccination teams continued to make more progress, and 11,921 people have received Merck's experimental VSV-EBOV vaccine, including 108 in Tchomia, where a pair of cases were recently detected near the border with Uganda.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday in a weekly situation update that overall, the proportion of contacts followed up daily has improved over the past week, rising to between 93% and 98%, compared with 85% to 94% the previous week.

The WHO added, however, that the improvement should be interpreted with caution, given that five of the confirmed cases reported over the past week involved unregistered contacts, which pose a greater risk of spreading the disease. The agency said that in Beni, the proportion of contacts traced fell to 35% on the day field activities were suspended following the Sep 22 violence.

""This highlights the need to reinforce contact listing and tracing of missing contacts who could eventually generate new transmission chains,"" the WHO said.

Vaccine trial raises pregnancy concerns

The vaccine study details a sub-study of a ring vaccination trial of VSV-EBOV that took place during Guinea's outbreak that was designed to look at humoral and cellular immune response and assess the frequency, incidence, and nature of adverse events, including serious ones. Researchers from Doctors Without Borders, Paris-based Epicentre, and Guinea published their findings yesterday in Vaccine.

Frontline workers were invited to participate, which included health workers, burial team members, and community outreach workers. The trial took place in Conakry from March 2015 to July 2016 and included 2,016 people who were vaccinated and 99 controls who had declined vaccination.

The researchers followed most participants for 3 months and followed a subset for 6 months, monitoring solicited and unsolicited adverse events at each visit. Women who became pregnant during follow-up were monitored for the duration of their pregnancies.

In the 3 days following vaccination, adverse events were very common, with 70% of participants reporting at least one. The most common symptoms were headache, fatigue, joint pain, subjective fever, and myalgia. Of those who kept fever diaries, 15.2% reported post-vaccination fever. The adverse events typically disappeared within 3 to 4 days.

Compared with the control group, local reaction, fatigue, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, and subjective fever within the first 3 days was statistically significant. Eight serious adverse events were reported, two of them related to pregnancy.

The authors wrote that the proportions of patients reporting fever after vaccination was similar to phase 1 and phase 2 trials of the vaccine and that vaccine-related fever has also been reported for two other Ebola vaccine platforms—the chimpanzee- and human adenovirus–vectored versions.

They noted that fever is a concern during an Ebola outbreak, given that fever could point to an active infection. They added that managing fever in future uses of the vaccine in outbreak settings would need protocols to distinguish adverse events after vaccination and suspected Ebola.

The negative outcomes in pregnant women is also a concern, they said, but Ebola infection during pregnancy has also been linked to high rates of complications. In addition, Ebola infections in pregnant women pose added risk to health workers, they note, adding that it's critical to collect more information on the safety of the vaccine in pregnant women to guide future recommendations.

27-Sep-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is at a critical juncture. While substantial progress has been made, the situation is precarious given recent increases in insecurity, incidents of community reluctance and geographical spread.

There have been a number of incidents in recent days, notably in Beni, which have led to loss of life among the local communities. WHO response activities have been severely limited as Beni and other towns mark a period of mourning for those who were killed. Security in Beni and other areas remains challenging.

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to work closely with people in the affected areas to overcome reluctance and mistrust which has developed among some communities. Rumours, misinformation and traditional practices have led some families to opt to care for sick relatives at home; some patients have also left health facilities to seek alternative care. Together this results in health workers being unable to provide optimal treatment, and also increases the risk of infection for relatives and local community members. These factors have contributed to the geographical spread of the outbreak.

The movement of several cases across health zones in recent weeks is concerning; one infected individual who recently moved to Kalunguta Health Zone is the first to move into a 'red' zone - highly insecure and challenging environments where implementing response activities is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Responders are employing a range of new techniques in these red zones, including using armed escorts and training local health workers to trace contacts.

Where they have access, response teams continue to enhance activities to prevent new clusters and the potential spread to new areas. WHO continues to work in the affected areas, side-by-side with national and international partners, to support the response led by the MoH. There continues to be challenges with identifying all contacts, registered contacts being lost to follow up, delayed recognition of EVD in health centres, poor infection prevention and control (IPC) in health centres, and reluctance among some cases to be treated in Ebola treatment centres (ETCs). The priority remains strengthening all components of the public health response in all affected areas, as well as continuing to enhance operational readiness and preparedness in the non-affected provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in neighbouring countries.

Since the last Disease Outbreak News (data as of 18 September), nine new confirmed EVD cases were reported: five from Beni, one from Butembo and one from Mabalako health zones in North Kivu Province, as well as two from Tchomia Health Zone in Ituri Province. These are the first confirmed EVD cases to be reported from Tchomia Health Zone which is near the Ugandan border; both cases, a couple, were linked to the ongoing Beni transmission chain. Two of the remaining seven cases have been linked to ongoing transmission chains within the respective communities, while the last five cases are under investigation.

As of 25 September 2018, a total of 151 EVD cases (120 confirmed and 31 probable), including 101 deaths (70 confirmed and 31 probable)1, have been reported in seven health zones in North Kivu Province (Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Mabalako, Masereka, Musienene and Oicha), and two health zones in Ituri Province (Mandima and Tchomia) (Figure 1). An overall decreasing trend in weekly case incidence continues (Figure 2); however, these trends must be interpreted with caution given the expected delays in case reporting, the ongoing detection of sporadic cases and the security situation which is limiting contact tracing. Of the 149 confirmed and probable cases for whom age and sex information is known, 23%, 20% and 22% are aged 15-24, 25-34 and 35-44 years, respectively; females (56%) accounted for the greatest proportion of cases (Figure 3). Cumulatively, 19 (18 confirmed and one probable) health workers have been affected to date, three of whom have died.

The MoH, WHO and partners continue to closely monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in neighbouring countries. As of 25 September, 17 suspected cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are awaiting laboratory testing. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as in neighbouring countries; and to date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts from neighbouring provinces and countries.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC measures, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

As of 18 September, 201 experts have been deployed by WHO to support response activities including emergency coordinators, epidemiologists, laboratory experts, logisticians, clinical care specialists, communicators and community engagement specialists.

Over 5700 contacts have been registered, of which 1660 remain under surveillance as of 25 September 2 . From 19 to 25 September, a high proportion of contacts ranging between 95-98% were followed up daily; however, coverage fell to between 60-76% from 23 to 25 September due to the suspension of field activities in Beni and a new front of operations in Tchomia..

. From 19 to 25 September, a high proportion of contacts ranging between 95-98% were followed up daily; however, coverage fell to between 60-76% from 23 to 25 September due to the suspension of field activities in Beni and a new front of operations in Tchomia.. As of 25 September, 63 vaccination rings have been defined in addition to 26 rings of health workers and other frontline workers. These rings include the contacts (and their contacts) of all confirmed cases from the last four weeks. To date, 12 029 people consented and were vaccinated, including 5041 health or frontline workers and 2497 children. The ring vaccination teams are currently active in three health areas in North Kivu and two in Ituri.

ETCs are operational in Beni and Mangina with support from the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), respectively. MSF Switzerland and the MoH are supporting an ETC in Butembo. International Medical Corps (IMC) is supporting the recently opened Makeke ETC in Ituri Province. MSF and the MoH are setting up a 12-bed isolation facility in Kasenyi.

WASH and IPC activities are ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and are supported by several partners in the field. Numerous activities have occurred in health facilities in the affected areas including facility assessments, decontamination of centres, establishment of triage areas and training on standard precautions as well as Ebola-specific IPC measures.

The MoH, WHO, UNICEF, Red Cross and partners are intensifying activities to engage with local communities in the affected areas. Community feedback is being systematically collected and concerns are being addressed. Local frontline community outreach workers are collaborating with Ebola response teams to strengthen community engagement and psychosocial support in contact tracing, patient care, SDBs and vaccination of close contacts. The focus continues to be on intensifying activities aimed at addressing community concerns through direct partnership with community members.

Red Cross SDB teams are trained and operational in Mabalako, Beni and Butembo health zones. Due to the new confirmed EVD cases in Ituri, the Red Cross is strengthening response capacity in Bunia where one SDB team was initially trained. In preparation, training of Red Cross SDB teams in Goma started on 24 September. Civil protection SDB teams from Beni, Butembo and Oicha have been trained as part of the ‘red zone strategy’. As of 24 September, Red Cross SDB teams have successfully responded to 144 of the 176 SDB alerts received; 37% of alerts were for community deaths, 36% were from ETCs and 27% were from non-ETC health facilities. In addition, four alerts were sent to the civil protection SDB teams.

Expert teams have deployed to six at-risk provinces (Bas Uele, Haut Uele, Ituri, Maniema, South Kivu and Tanganika) to facilitate implementation of priority readiness actions, including strengthening multisectoral coordination, surveillance for early detection, laboratory diagnostic capacity, points of entry (PoE) surveillance, rapid response teams, risk communication, social mobilization and community engagement, psychosocial support, case management and IPC capacities, operations support, and logistics.

As of 25 September, health screening has been established at 45 PoEs and close to six million travellers have been screened and over 17 000 means of travel have been decontaminated at these PoEs.

To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. Among the partners are a number of UN agencies and international organizations including International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operation (ECHO), UK Public Health Rapid Support Team, multiple Clusters, and peacekeeping operations; World Bank and regional development banks; African Union, Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and regional agencies; Health Cluster partners and NGOs including ALIMA, ADECO, AFNAC, CARITAS, CEPROSSAN, CARE, COOPI, CORDAID, ICRC, IFRC, INTERSOS, MEDAIR, MSF, OXFAM, PNHF, Samaritan’s Purse, and SCI; Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), Steering Committee, technical networks and operational partners, and the Emergency Medical Team (EMT) Initiative. GOARN partners continue to support the response through deployment for response and readiness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries and to different levels of WHO.

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri continues to hinder the implementation of response activities. Since the last Disease Outbreak News on 20 September 2018, WHO has assessed the risk to be very high at the national and regional levels, and low globally3.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities3. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure health authorities are alerted and are operationally ready to respond.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no countries have implemented any travel restriction to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

""This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan,"" the WHO said in a statement. ""Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries.""

Recent violence by armed rebels in Beni, the site of the WHO's response efforts in eastern DRC, has led the agency to call this week a ""critical juncture"" in the outbreak.

""WHO response activities have been severely limited as Beni and nearby towns mark a period of mourning for those who were killed. Security in Beni and other areas remains challenging,"" the WHO said. The agency added that rumors and traditional practices have led relatives to care for sick family members at home, which increased the risk for infection.

The past week has also seen Ebola patients move in to ""red zones,"" insecure communities that health workers cannot reach.

Four more cases in Beni

Yesterday and today the DRC's health ministry reported four more Ebola patients, all in Beni, two of whom are known contacts who declined vaccination but voluntarily went to an Ebola treatment center after their symptoms began.

The health ministry today also noted 1 new death in Beni. There are now a total of 155 cases (124 confirmed, 31 probable), including 102 deaths, in this outbreak. Eleven suspected cases are currently under investigation.

As of Sep 26, response efforts in Beni resumed after a period of mourning following the Sep 22 attacks in the city lifted. DRC officials said there was more enthusiasm and cooperation among community members in the Ndindi district, which has been referred to as Beni's ""cradle of resistance."" The DRC said residents of Ndindi voluntarily registered to get vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine.

Since vaccination began on Aug 8, a total of 12,250 people have been vaccinated against Ebola, the health ministry said, including 4,122 in Mabalako, 3,712 in Beni, 1,632 in Mandima, 884 in Butembo, 993 in Katwa, 270 in Masereka, 164 in Komanda, 177 in Tchomia, 121 in Oicha, 110 in Bunia, and 65 in Kinshasa.

According to the WHO, of the 149 confirmed and probable cases for whom age and sex are known, 23%, 20%, and 22% are aged 15 to 24, 25 to 34, and 35 to 44 years, respectively; females accounted for 56% cases. A total of 19 healthcare workers, 3 of whom have died, have been infected.

All of the cases are from the most recent disease hot spots, Beni, which has experienced civil unrest and community resistance, and Butembo, a large city near the Uganda border.

Political overtones in Butembo

In its Sep 29 report, the DRC health ministry reported two new cases, one in Beni and one in Butembo.

The case-patient from Butembo is a woman whose symptoms began on Sep 20, but her family members initially refused to transfer her to an Ebola treatment center and instead hid her. They refused to meet with Ebola responders without the presence of members of the ""Standing Parliament,"" a district political pressure group that they support.

When the woman's condition worsened, the pressure group, which had been in negotiations with responders in Butembo, called on emergency teams to transfer her to the treatment center.

The woman tested positive for Ebola upon her arrival, and health officials registered her family, members of the lobby group, and the aligned member of parliament, Crispin Mbindule Mitono, as at-risk contacts, and all agreed to be vaccinated.

According to the health ministry, Mitono had been quoted in the media in August as saying he believed Ebola was created in laboratories and moved from Equateur province to Beni to exterminate the population, and he had pushed his supporters to resist vaccination.

Getting Mitono and the pressure group on board with response steps is an important breakthrough, the health ministry said, according to a machine translation of its update. ""Thus, the involvement of [Mitono] and the pressure group is a major step forward in social mobilization and the lifting of the last Butembo resistance wall,"" it added.

Unsafe burial in probable case

Yesterday, the health ministry reported two more cases in Beni, one of them a confirmed infection involving a patient who died shortly after arriving at the Ebola treatment center.

The other is classified as a new probable case, a contact of the last confirmed case-patient who died a day earlier and was buried by his family without safety precautions. In Ebola outbreaks, unsafe burials have been known to pose a high risk of virus spread.

The latest developments push the outbreak total to 159 cases, 127 of them confirmed. The two deaths put the fatality count at 104.

Call to end Beni stigmatization

In another development yesterday, the DRC outbreak coordinator held a press conference in Beni to detail the impact the recent community protests had on the outbreak response.

He said contact tracing dipped from 98% to 50% during the protest days, held in the wake of deadly violence between rebels and DRC armed forces, and that the actions slowed active case finding and port-of-entry monitoring.

Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe, MD, said the protest sidelined vaccination activities for 3 days and brought sample testing to a halt on Sep 25. Also, he said the actions hurt disinfection efforts and impeded the supply of personal protective equipment for health providers.

He also urged the media to stop stigmatizing the Beni population, noting that the city's population has been very cooperative with response teams and that cases of resistance in Beni have been limited to one or two families that are linked to the spread of the virus to Butembo and Tchomia.

Overall, the number of people vaccinated has reached 12,940, including 3,958 in Beni.

The cases illustrate the challenges facing DRC and World Health Organization (WHO) health workers in the conflict-ridden region.

Cases climb to 161

Officials have now reported 161 cases of Ebola in DRC, including 105 deaths. Nine cases are still under investigation. Though case counts have slowed in recent weeks, the outbreak is still ongoing in an insecure, unstable region, the WHO's regional office for Africa said in a weekly update.

The first new case involved a woman from Beni who died. DRC officials said she was the daughter of another Ebola patient who passed away at the Beni Ebola treatment center on Sep 22. The family refused vaccination and follow-up care.

The second case is man from Komanda. He belonged to a family that also refused vaccination, and was known to be behind pockets of resistance in the region. The man's sister-in-law was the first Ebola case-patient in Tchomia, near the Ugandan border. According to officials, the man fled Tchomia after his sister-in-law's death and was found hospitalized in a health post in Komanda. He will be transferred to the Tchomia isolation center.

Officials also said that Beni, a city in North Kivu province, remains the epicenter of recent virus activity, noting that 8 of the 9 cases confirmed from Sep 24 to 30 occurred in the city, as well as all 4 deaths reported during the same period.

""Beni is reporting an increasing number of all new cases, indicating the persistence of active transmission of Ebola virus in this area. The Beni Health Zone has reported 60% of all cases reported since early September 2018,"" the WHO said.

As of Sep 28, 91% of case contacts in Beni are being followed. The WHO also said that, as of Sep 25, three DRC refugees in Uganda are being monitored. The refugees are case contacts of a fatal case in Tchomia.

Vaccination with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine is still ongoing in North Kivu, the DRC health ministry noted. Since Aug 8, a total of 13,208 people have been vaccinated, including 4,207 in Mabalako, 4,095 in Beni, 1,632 in Mandima, 1,193 in Katwa, 944 in Butembo, 270 in Masereka, 260 in Tchomia, 257 in Bunia, 164 in Komanda, 121 in Oicha, and 65 in Kinshasa.

Also yesterday, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) announced the deployment of a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to DRC in an effort to bring an elite team of disaster and health experts from USAID and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the region.

""The team of disaster experts will expand life-saving healthcare, water and sanitation, and other critical assistance to prevent the spread of the disease. The DART will also work closely with the Government of the DRC and health organizations to provide technical expertise,"" USAID said in a statement.

Sep 28 WHO weekly summary

Oct 1 USAID statement",no result found,no result found,no result found,"Nurses working with the WHO prepare to administer Ebola vaccines in Mbandaka, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Public health officials are expressing deepening concern that the latest Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo may be spinning beyond their control and could soon spill over into neighboring countries including Uganda and Rwanda.

With Ebola response teams facing restrictions on their movements in a conflict zone, officials fear containment efforts are falling further behind the virus. And if response teams lose sight of where the virus goes, it could spread undetected and unchecked in places where they cannot safely travel.

“At this point in an epidemic, we’d probably be peaking in terms of knowing where the virus is. And now with the insecurity, that’s compromised,” said Dr. Mike Ryan, assistant director-general of the World Health Organization’s emergency preparedness and response program.

advertisement

To date in this outbreak — DRC’s 10th — there have been 161 cases and 105 deaths.

The threat of a widening epidemic was compounded with a discovery last week that two people infected with Ebola had fled from the Congolese city of Beni to Tchomia, near the border with Uganda, prompting the WHO to warn that the risk that the virus will spread to DRC’s eastern neighbors is “very high.” Previously the risk of regional spread had been assessed as high. (The risk of spread outside the region remains low.)

Uganda and Rwanda, with the help of the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other international partners, have been preparing for weeks to deal with the possibility of imported cases.

Uganda’s drug regulatory agency has been going through the process of approving a protocol to use an Ebola vaccine being developed by Merck; that vaccine is currently being deployed in DRC in a “ring vaccination” strategy. Under the approach, people who have been in contact with an Ebola case — and the contacts of each contact — are vaccinated to block the virus’s ability to spread.

Uganda is planning to adopt the ring vaccination strategy as well.

But it also intends to pre-vaccinate health workers in high-risk health zones near the DRC border. Initial supplies of vaccine are already in the country and that work could start within days.

“We hope this will start very soon,” said Dr. Socé Fall, regional emergencies director for the WHO’s regional office for Africa. Fall said he expects health workers in Uganda will agree to be vaccinated with the still-experimental vaccine. Uganda has a long history of Ebola outbreaks — it has had more than any other country except DRC.

“Ugandan health care workers — they know Ebola already. They know the risks,” Fall said.

The CDC currently has staff in Uganda working on the vaccination program, said Ray Arthur, a co-leader of the Ebola coordination team for the agency. “The protocols are with the institutional review board, with the government, and the vaccine is in Entebbe,” he said.

Uganda — which has been conducting fever checks at border crossings to identify any possible Ebola cases — is monitoring the health of two people who recently entered the country and who may have been exposed to the virus.

“They are being monitored on the Uganda side to make sure that if something happened they will be isolated very quickly,” Fall said of the two, who haven’t been tested because as yet they haven’t shown symptoms of illness.

Although DRC originally said the pair may have been exposed to Ebola during the burial of an Ebola patient there, officials later determined that was not the case. (Traditional burial ceremonies, in which attendees may touch or kiss the corpse of the deceased, can be major Ebola transmission events. That’s because around the time of death and even after, the skin of a person who died from Ebola teems with viruses.)

There is a sense that Uganda, in particular, is well prepared to cope with imported cases. “Uganda has done a fine job,” Ryan said.

Arthur concurred. CDC has a country office in Uganda, he explained, and other staff from the agency have traveled to the country to help its health ministry identify where Ebola patients could be treated if cases occur. The CDC has also advised the staff on border health issues and infection control — which is critical to ensuring people with Ebola do not infect other patients or the health workers caring for them.

“Should cases come into the country, we would expect transmission would be quite limited,” Arthur said.

Preparedness efforts are also underway in Rwanda, which is further from the outbreak epicenter, and in South Sudan.

While experts have some confidence DRC’s neighbors are ready to spot and isolate Ebola cases if there are importations, they appear to feel less assured about how containment efforts are progressing in DRC.

A rebel attack on Beni about 10 days ago killed a number of civilians and led to the declaration of several days of city-wide mourning — days in which shops and schools closed and during which the response teams had to cut back their efforts.

Most importantly the tracking of case contacts suffered, at a time when this critical effort was already failing to register all the people who had been in contact with confirmed cases.

“Our whole strategy is based on knowing where the virus is, identifying cases, identifying contacts, contacts of contacts, isolation, vaccination, community education,” Ryan explained. “And that whole strategy is predicated on a deeper and deeper and more and more precise day-by-day knowledge of where the virus is.”

The health of contacts who are being followed is monitored regularly; if they get sick, authorities ask to take them to Ebola treatment units — in Ebola parlance an ETU — where they can be treated in isolation and where the risk is low that they will infect anyone else.

But contacts who don’t make it onto the follow-up lists don’t get offered vaccine. Because they are not recognized as potential Ebola cases, if they get sick their illness may evade detection. They may end up being cared for at home and being buried without proper precautions if they die. That can result in new infections among caregivers or funeral attendees.

In the last couple of weeks, a number of newly diagnosed Ebola patients were people who were not on a contact list. Five such cases were reported late last week by the WHO.

“You should not have cases occurring which weren’t on a contact list,” Arthur said. “There’s been too many of those in the past two weeks.”

Fall said further investigation showed all five had been in contact with a known case — which is moderately reassuring.

In the midst of an Ebola outbreak, realizing your contact list was incomplete is bad. But finding a case with no discernible link to other cases is worse. That signals that there are chains of transmission that response teams aren’t aware of and aren’t tracking. “Then you lose the virus,” Ryan said. “The virus leaves the trail.”

Drawing up a full list of the contacts of a case is slow and painstaking work, Ryan said — work that isn’t well-suited to a conflict zone.

“Each one of those is an individual detective story. You need to spend time and sit with the family … ‘What happened here? And when did you move there? And what wedding did you go to?’” Ryan explained.

“If you’re looking over your shoulder worrying about a bullet coming through the window or the door, these encounters become very, very strained,” Ryan continued. “Surveillance officers are nervous. And then if you add into that community mistrust and the misinformation, that participation and the acceptance of the community is affected.”

The effort isn’t helped by the fact that there are now cases in multiple different communities in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. That expansion of the area the response teams need to cover has created huge logistical challenges.

“We’re now in nine health zones,” Arthur said. “And the longer the transmission occurs, obviously the greater risk for it to get into an area where’s not good contact tracing or there aren’t vaccination programs in place.”

“Each time there’s extension into a new area, all that infrastructure — laboratories, ETUs, contact tracing, vaccination teams — has to be re-established. And that takes time,” he said. “So I think we’re in a position now where we’re playing catch up and that’s not the kind of position we want to be in.”

There are still 18 cases under investigation, the DRC said. The outbreak total stands at 161 cases and 106 deaths. Of the total cases, 129 have been laboratory confirmed.

Officials also offered clarification about two Congolese refugees who are being tracked after crossing the border into Uganda.

""Contrary to what has been reported in some media, the two Congolese nationals who arrived in Uganda where they are followed by the national health authorities did not participate in the burial of a confirmed case of Ebola in Kasenyi,"" the DRC said.

Egg-related Salmonella outbreak sickens 24 more and reaches 7 states

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) yesterday reported 24 more illnesses in a Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak linked to eggs from Alabama-based Gravel Ridge Farms, and health officials have identified the outbreak strain in environmental and egg samples from the farm that produced the eggs.

In its update, the CDC said the outbreak total has grown to 38 cases, including 10 patients who were hospitalized for their infections. No deaths have been reported. Five more states reported cases (Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Ohio, and Montana), raising that total to seven. Illness-onset dates range from Jun 17 to Aug 16.

Of 29 people interviewed about foods they ate and other exposures a week before they got sick, 22 had eaten restaurant dishes made with eggs, significantly higher than the percentage of healthy people who were surveyed. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and state health partners traced the eggs supplied to the restaurant and found that Gravel Ridge Farms supplied them to restaurants where 19 of the 22 people ate. Eight people live in states where the company's eggs are not sold, including six who traveled to states where Gravel Ridge eggs were sold.

An FDA update yesterday said it and the Alabama Department of Agriculture began an inspection at the farm on Sep 5 and collected environmental samples for testing. It said results confirm that Salmonella Enteritidis isolates collected from the environment and from egg samples were genetically related to samples from sick patients.

The company had recalled the eggs on Sep 8, which were primarily distributed to restaurants and retail stores in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee.

WHO: 1.4 million in Zimbabwe to be vaccined against cholera

The government of Zimbabwe and the World Health Organization (WHO) today announced plans to vaccinate 1.4 million people in the country's capital, Harare, with the oral choral vaccine (OCV).

According to the WHO, the vaccine comes from the global stockpile, which is funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Gavi is also funding operational costs for the campaign.

""The current cholera outbreak is geographically concentrated in the densely populated suburbs of Harare,"" said Matshidiso Moeti, MD, the WHO's regional director for Africa, in a press release. ""We have a window of opportunity to strike back with the oral cholera vaccine now, which along with other efforts will help keep the current outbreak in check and may prevent it from spreading further into the country and becoming more difficult to control.""

The vaccination campaign will be rolled out in two waves and take place at fixed sites, including health facilities, schools, and shopping centers.

The Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) of Zimbabwe said the outbreak began on Sep 6 in Harare, after 25 patients were hospitalized with symptoms of the diarrheal disease. The index patient was identified as a 25-year-old woman who died in Harare.

As of Sep 15, the MoHCC has recorded 3,621 illnesses, including 71 confirmed cases and 32 deaths (case-fatality rate, 0.8%). Ninety-eight percent (3,564 cases) were in Harare.

In August 2008 to May 2009, Zimbabwe experienced a massive cholera outbreak that took more than 4,000 lives.

4-Oct-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is at a critical juncture. WHO faces a precarious situation given recent increases in insecurity, incidents of community mistrust, and increased geographical spread.

The period of mourning and general strike (ville morte) in Beni, Butembo and Mabalako has officially ended; the ville morte was organized by civil society leaders following an attack in Beni on 22 September, in which 21 people were killed. Activities that had slowed during the ville morte period included health workers being unable to reach and monitor the health of Ebola patient contacts, social mobilization and community engagement efforts significantly slowed or suspended, risk communications seriously constrained or suspended in areas highly impacted by EVD, and severe limitations on field teams’ ability to investigate alerts of suspected cases and carry out safe and dignified burials. WHO operations are currently back to full scale; however, WHO remains vigilant given ongoing security constraints.

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to work closely with people in the affected areas. Most communities support the response efforts and are open to vaccination and treatment; collaboration between communities and local authorities is ongoing to overcome the reluctance and mistrust which has developed in some places. Faced with rumours and misinformation, some families have chosen to care for sick relatives at home, increasing the risk of transmission to caregivers, family and children. Some patients have also left health facilities to seek alternative care, or actively avoid follow-up from health workers. Despite concerted efforts by local community leaders to ensure safe and dignified burials, in some cases these are rejected in favour of traditional practices. Avoiding contact with health workers, home care and unsafe burials all increase the risk to patients themselves, caregivers, children and other family members, and to health/frontline workers, and have contributed to the spread of the outbreak.

The affected areas now cover hundreds of kilometres, including a confirmed case who has moved into a ‘red zone’ - a highly insecure and challenging environment where implementing response activities is extremely difficult. The geographic expansion further strains frontline resources, as an effective Ebola response requires hubs established in multiple locations, as close as possible to the affected population.

Where they have access, response teams continue to enhance activities to prevent new clusters and the potential spread to new areas. WHO continues to work in the affected areas, side-by-side with national and international partners, to support the response led by the MoH. The outbreak’s spread into new, insecure areas in Tchomia Health Zone (with close proximity to the Ugandan border), as well as ongoing security concerns, continues to challenge the overall response. In light of these conditions, WHO revised its risk assessment and elevated the national and regional levels from ‘high risk’ to ‘very high risk’; globally, the risk remains low.

Since the last Disease Outbreak News (data as of 2 October), ten (10) new confirmed EVD cases were reported: eight from Beni and one from Butembo Health Zones in North Kivu, and one from Komanda Health Zone in Ituri. Eight of these confirmed cases have been linked to known cases or transmission chains within the respective communities, while the two other cases remain under investigation.

As of 2 October 2018, a total of 162 EVD cases (130 confirmed and 32 probable), including 106 deaths (74 confirmed and 32 probable) , have been reported in seven health zones in North Kivu Province (Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Mabalako, Masereka, Musienene and Oicha), and three health zones in Ituri Province (Mandima, Komanda and Tchomia) (Figure 1). An overall slightly decreasing trend in weekly case incidence continues (Figure 2); however, these trends must be interpreted with caution given the expected delays in case reporting, the ongoing detection of sporadic cases, and security concerns which limit contact tracing and investigation of alerts. Of the 155 confirmed and probable cases for whom age and sex information is known, 22%, 19% and 23% are aged 15-24, 25-34 and 35-44 years, respectively; females (55%) accounted for the greatest proportion of cases (Figure 3). Cumulatively, 19 (18 confirmed and one probable) health workers have been affected to date, three of whom have died.

The MoH, WHO and partners continue to closely monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries. As of 2 October, 11 suspected cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are awaiting laboratory testing. Since the last Disease Outbreak News report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as in neighbouring countries. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts from neighbouring provinces and countries.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC measures, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

As of 2 October, over 200 experts have been deployed by WHO to support response activities including emergency coordinators, epidemiologists, laboratory experts, logisticians, clinical care specialists, communicators and community engagement specialists.

Over 5700 contacts have been registered, of which approximately 1900 remain under surveillance as of 2 October 2 . Following the conclusion of a ville morte imposed in Beni, Butembo and Mabalako Health Zones, there has been a marked improvement in the proportion of follow-up contacts on the day of reporting, with the proportion rising to 93% (1768/1900) from 78% (1401/1785) seven days prior. Beni Health Zone has the greatest challenges in contact tracing as a result of the deteriorating security situation.

Beni Health Zone has the greatest challenges in contact tracing as a result of the deteriorating security situation. As of 2 October, 69 vaccination rings have been defined in addition to 26 rings of health and frontline workers. To date, 13,758 people consented and were vaccinated, including 5678 health or frontline workers and 2915 children. Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) are operational in Beni and Mangina with support from the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), respectively. MSF Switzerland and the MoH are supporting an ETC in Butembo. International Medical Corps (IMC) is supporting the recently opened Makeke ETC in Ituri Province. MSF and the MoH are setting up a 12-bed isolation facility in Kasenyi. An isolation unit is being developed from existing facilities in Tchomia.

WASH and IPC activities are ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and are supported by several partners in the field. Numerous activities have occurred in health facilities in the affected areas including facility assessments, decontamination of centres, establishment of triage areas and training on standard precautions as well as Ebola-specific IPC measures. A comprehensive plan to strengthen IPC in 200 health facilities, with WHO’s support, aims to: train medical staff; provide IPC kits; and replace incinerated materials in health facilities and households.

The MoH, WHO, UNICEF, Red Cross and partners are intensifying activities to engage with local communities in the affected areas. Due to conditions imposed by a community-declared ville morte from 24-28 September 2018, social mobilization teams were in lockdown for five days in Beni and unable to engage with communities; the situation in Beni has since improved. Engagement with local leaders in Ndindi in the past weeks has helped increase community ownership, with positive signs that leaders are actively reporting suspected cases through a telephone hotline. More collaboration has also been observed between local authorities and community focal points. Local frontline community outreach workers are collaborating with Ebola response teams to strengthen community engagement and psychosocial support in contact tracing, patient care, SDBs and vaccination of close contacts. In Butembo, community engagement was strengthened through collaboration with a popular singer, Mayaya Santa, producing a song with key messages about Ebola response. The activation of Tchomia’s communication commission has been a priority, and a meeting organized with two religious networks successfully reached 233 leaders from 141 churches in Tchomia Health Zone; youth leaders and motor taxi associations were also engaged as part of the meeting.

Red Cross SDB teams are trained and operational in Mangina, Beni, Butembo, Oicha and Tchomia. Further operational capacity is being built in Bunia. Trained SDB teams in Mambasa and Goma are without full operational capacity at this point. As of 1 October, Red Cross SDB teams have successfully responded to 162 of the 194 SDB alerts received. In addition, six alerts had not been responded to due to security concerns, and one alert response was pending.

The WHO Regional Office for Africa has updated the regional preparedness plan and reprioritized neighbouring countries based on proximity to North Kivu, the current EVD epicentre. The new prioritizations are as follows: Priority 1: Rwanda, Uganda, South Sudan and Burundi; Priority 2: Angola, Congo, Central African Republic, Tanzania, Zambia. These countries were prioritised based on their capacity to manage EVD and viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, and their connections and proximity to the areas currently reporting EVD cases.

WHO and partners have supported the strengthening of Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC) in five countries (Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia). Although PHEOC has not been fully established in the remaining countries, the MoH has a national taskforce that meets regularly to discuss EVD preparedness measures. WHO, in collaboration with the MoH and other partners in the field, has developed and updated their national contingency plan and shared this with all key stakeholders. WHO, in collaboration with partners (CDC, UNICEF, OCHA, IOM, GOARN, UK-Med, etc), is supporting the deployment of experts to provide technical support to the Ministries of Health on the implementation of EVD preparedness activities.

As of 2 October, health screening has been established at 53 Points of Entry (PoEs) and close to 6.5 million travellers have been screened. IOM and PNHF have revised the PoE strategy for Ituri, with more focus on on-site supervision of local surveillance staffs at PoEs by IOM epidemiologists.

To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. Among the partners are a number of UN agencies and international organizations including: European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operation (ECHO; International Organization for Migration (IOM); the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF); UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR); World Food Programme (WFP); United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC); UK Public Health Rapid Support Team; multiple Clusters, peacekeeping operations and the UN mission; UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS); World Bank and regional development banks; African Union, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and regional agencies; Health Cluster partners and NGOs including ALIMA, ADECO, AFNAC, CARITAS DRC, CEPROSSAN, CARE International, COOPI, CORDAID/PAP-DRC, ICRC, IFRC, Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, INTERSOS, IRC, MEDAIR, MSF, PNHF, Samaritan’s Purse, and SCI; Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), Steering Committee, EDPLN, ECCARN, technical networks and operational partners, and the Emergency Medical Team (EMT) Initiative. GOARN partners continue to support the response through deployment for response and readiness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries and to different levels of WHO.

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country, which borders Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri may hinder the implementation of response activities. On 28 September 2018, based on the worsening security situation, WHO revised its risk assessment for the outbreak, elevating the risk at national and regional levels from high to very high. The risk remains low globally. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international travel to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

1The number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and the availability of laboratory results.

Violence includes another attack on a Red Cross safe burial team and escalating armed group attacks on Beni residents.

In a speech to the United Nations Security Council yesterday, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said the frequency and intensity of attacks by armed groups near Beni seem to be increasing. And he said responders are also worried about pockets of mistrust and the spread of Ebola into inaccessible ""red zones"" held by armed groups.

""This spread is extending the long tail of the outbreak,"" he said, adding that the detection of cases near the Uganda border is also a big worry.

Tedros urged the Security Council to use its influence to ensure uninterrupted access to the affected areas and for countries to pledge more international support. He said so far, the DRC has received $8 million in pledges out of a request for $33 million.

Total cases reach 165; vaccination tops 14,000

The health ministry yesterday reported one new case in Beni and today reported two more from the same city, plus another in Mabalako. The developments push the outbreak total to 165 infections, including 133 confirmed and 32 probable cases. No new deaths were reported, keeping the fatality total at 106.

Health officials are still investigating 24 suspected cases.

In other outbreak developments, the DRC health ministry said a man who is part of a pocket of community resistance who fled to Komanda where he sought treatment after his sister-in-law died in Tchomia was transferred to an Ebola treatment center in Beni. His wife and child have been vaccinated and are in isolation at the same treatment center.

Also, officials said that, to show support for vaccination, North Kivu's governor along with nine provincial deputies agreed to be immunized against Ebola, with the local press invited to document the event to help raise awareness and counter misinformation.

So far, 14,017 people have been vaccinated, and vaccination continues in six belts in Beni, Tchomia, Komanda, and Mabalako health zones.

Burial team attacked

Meanwhile, three Red Cross volunteers were injured on Oct 2, following an attack while conducting a safe and dignified burial in Butembo, the large city where several Ebola cases have been reported in recent weeks.

Two of the volunteers were seriously wounded and are being treated, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said today in a press release. The organization said Red Cross teams have faced incidents of violence and aggression from communities resisting burial protocols designed to limit the spread of the virus since the start of North Kivu province's Ebola outbreak.

The bodies of people who die from Ebola are highly infectious, and, in West Africa's 2014-16 outbreak, Red Cross burial teams played a critical role in curbing the spread of the disease. More than 180 trained Red Cross volunteers are working in the outbreak region, and teams have carried out 162 safe and dignified burials.

The IFRC said that in September one Red Cross volunteer was hurt when people stoned a transport vehicle, but this week's attack was the most violent incident so far.

Fatoumata Nafo-Traoré, MD, the IFRC's regional director for Africa, said, ""While we categorically denounce the attack on our colleagues, we understand the fear and frustration that many communities in North Kivu feel right now. People are scared and there are many rumours circulating that only serve to heighten the sense of fear and distrust.""

Group urges probe of violence

In another development, Human Rights Watch yesterday called on the International Criminal Court (ICC) to expand its Congo investigation to include attacks that have been occurring since 2014 in Beni, including one on Sep 22 that killed 17 civilians and temporarily brought the Ebola response in the hot spot to a halt. The group said that 2 days later fighters attacked the town of Oicha, abducting 16 people, most of them children.

According to its press release, Human Rights Watch said unidentified fighters have killed more than 1,000 people in Beni in massacres that began 4 years ago, and so far this year, the violence has killed at least 235 people in more than 100 attacks. The group also called on the United Nations peacekeeping mission to boost its analysis capabilities and community engagement to identify who is responsible for the attacks and improve security for Beni's citizens.

Ida Sawyer, deputy Africa director for Human Rights Watch, said the brutal killings of Beni residents won't end until commanders of the responsible groups are brought to justice.

""As Congolese authorities have not credibly investigated or prosecuted these atrocities, the International Criminal Court should investigate them for future trials,"" she said.

Human Rights Watch said the ICC has jurisdiction over serious international crimes committed in the Congo and has been investigating crimes there since 2004. Though the ICC has brought several cases to trial, the rights group said the court has not prosecuted recent crimes.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Three volunteers for the Congolese Red Cross helping with the burial of an Ebola victim in eastern Congo were injured in an attack by villagers, prompting the International Committee of the Red Cross to suspend burials in the area, health officials said on Wednesday.

The attack on an ambulance transporting the body to a cemetery in North Kivu province’s Beni region is the latest disruption to efforts to control the current outbreak, which is believed to have killed 106 people since July.

The World Health Organization (WHO) last week raised its assessment of the risk of the disease spreading within the region to “very high” after a case was confirmed near a lakeside border crossing point with Uganda.

Community resistance in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has been one of the main problems facing healthcare workers, in addition to armed attacks by militia groups.

Serge Thierry, a regional ICRC representative, told Reuters that three local Red Cross volunteers were wounded, two seriously, in the attack by angry residents.

“Security measures were taken immediately. Burials are suspended until further notice,” he said by telephone, referring to ICRC activity in and around Butembo city in Beni region.

Proper burial of Ebola victims is critical to control the disease, which causes fever, vomiting and diarrhea, and is spread through direct contact with body fluids.

Robert Kahumula, the local spokesman for the Congolese Health Ministry’s Ebola response team., said the health workers “were wounded during an attack by young people, skeptical of the presence of Ebola in the region”.

“The burial did not take place because the young people ambushed the response team and vandalized the ambulance that was transporting the body,” he said.

The current epidemic in Congo’s North Kivu and Ituri provinces has seen 140 confirmed cases since July, 108 of whom have died, according to the ministry’s daily bulletin, which has been reporting an average of one to two new confirmed cases per day in recent weeks.

The ministry said the five new cases were located in the regional hub of Beni, where attacks by rebel groups in the area and local mistrust of the Ebola response campaign have disrupted treatment and vaccination programs.

“The town of Beni has become the new focus point of the disease, registering the highest percentage of cases reported in recent weeks following community resistance of certain families,” it said in a statement.

The fight against Ebola has advanced more in recent years since it was discovered near the Congo River in 1976, but rumors, misinformation and a preference for traditional medical practices have hampered the roll-out of effective treatments during the current outbreak.

Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the epidemic was at a critical juncture due to security threats, community mistrust and an increased geographical spread of the disease.

All but 2 of the cases were reported in Beni, the epicenter of the current outbreak.

There are now a total of 177 cases (142 confirmed and 35 probable), including 113 deaths. Eleven suspected cases are under investigation.

Second illness wave linked to challenging Beni cluster

In an Oct 5 update, DRC officials said the new cases represent ""a second wave of confirmed cases among refractory contacts"" among residents of the Ndindi neighborhood of Beni, who have been resisting outbreak response efforts since August. Besides the 10 cases in Beni, 2 cases have also been reported in Butembo.

Late last week, the DRC's minister of health, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, visited Beni to announce a new strategy.

""The city of Beni has been divided into 18 operational zones that correspond to the 18 health areas of the city. From now on, each health area will have a specific response team to carry out activities corresponding to the different pillars of the response,"" the DRC said, noting that more healthcare personnel have been deployed to the region.

Yesterday, the DRC revealed that in-depth investigations on the last five confirmed cases in Beni showed three probable cases in deceased persons who were buried before being tested for Ebola.

On Oct 6, the DRC updated its information about exploratory Ebola treatments currently be used in the outbreak. A total of 56 patients have been treated with mAb 114, remdesivir, ZMapp or Regeneron monoclonal antibodies. Of these 56 patients, 27 are cured and have been discharged, 14 have died, and 15 are still hospitalized.

Since Aug 8, 14,869 people have been vaccinated, including 5,072 in Beni, 4,269 in Mabalako, 1,663 in Mandima, 1,352 in Katwa, 1,100 in Butembo, 427 in Bunia, 355 in Tchomia, 270 in Masereka, 240 to Komanda, and 121 to Oicha.

Violence, resistance in North Kivu

In related news, The Lancet published results from a survey given to 582 residents of the current outbreak areas in August in the DRC, which showed that heavy violence in North Kivu is taking a toll on Ebola response efforts. Participants in the survey live in Mangina, Beni, and Butembo.

Compared with people in Guinea who answered similar questions during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, survey responders in North Kivu were more likely to resist response efforts and said heavy violence in the region was an impediment to getting health care.

""The survey results revealed some worrying attitudes: unwillingness to send a family member suspected of being infected with Ebola virus to an Ebola treatment unit (ETU; 101 [17%] of 580 participants in our survey vs <516 [<9%] of 5,733 participants in Guinea) and intention to hide family member from health authorities (101 [17%] of 581 participants in our survey vs 221 [4%] of 5,520 participants in Guinea),"" the authors said.

Two each of the new cases announced yesterday are in Beni and Butembo, which raise the recorded number of cases in these two cities in the past 4 days to 16.

Beni on track to be hardest hit

The DRC's ministry of health said the recent spike in cases in these areas confirms that case contacts during the initial wave of cases in August and September who avoided follow-up and vaccination have now been infected. Beni has been a hotbed of anti-response activity, especially the neighborhood of Ndindi.

""The factors contributing to this situation are mainly misinformation, non-collaboration of the population with the response teams and insecurity,"" the Health Ministry said in its daily update. ""More than two months after the declaration of the epidemic, the community continues to prevent the safe and dignified burial, and at-risk contacts still refuse vaccination and 21-day follow-up.""

Experts in the DRC now predict that cases in Beni will soon surpass totals in Mblanka, the first designated epicenter of North Kivu's outbreak. To date, Mblanka has confirmed 91 cases and 65 deaths.

As of yesterday, Beni has 57 confirmed or probable cases, and 35 deaths. Over the weekend DRC health officials said the new cases represent ""a second wave of confirmed cases among refractory contacts.""

Preparing for more cases in Beni

DRC officials said they are preparing Beni for the influx of cases. ""The Beni Ebola Treatment Center (ETC), which currently has 16 beds, will be expanded to accommodate at least 60 patients, additional doses of vaccines have been ordered, and additional epidemiologists will be deployed for alerts,"" they said.

Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, DRC public health minister, visited Beni last week and said response efforts would take a new direction in Beni, with the city divided into 18 health zones that will be surveyed closely. Also, additional vaccines and epidemiologists will be deployed to the area.

Since Aug 8, a total of 15,114 people have been vaccinated against Ebola, including 5,250 in Beni, 4,289 in Mabalako, 1,663 in Mandima, 1,392 in Katwa, 1,100 in Butembo, 434 in Bunia, 355 in Tchomia, 270 in Masereka, 240 to Komanda, and 121 to Oicha.

There are now 188 cases of the hemorrhagic fever disease in the outbreak, including 118 deaths, the DRC health ministry said. Twenty cases remain under investigation. There have been 23 new cases in the past 5 days, a contrast to previous recent weeks, which saw only a trickle of cases.

As of today, four administrative measures will be put in place in Beni, the new epicenter of the outbreak, the health ministry said. The steps include making it illegal to harbor a suspected Ebola patient, using security forces to monitor and implement safe burials, requiring families to show official death certificates before obtaining a burial certificate, and obligating all health professionals (including traditional healers) to report suspected cases to Ebola treatment centers.

Officials said the new decree comes after a month of attacks and acts of resistance to response efforts in Beni and the surrounding areas. Though the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu province began on Aug 1 in Mblanka, activity has now moved to Beni as health workers fight a second wave of cases connected to people who refused vaccination or dodged case contact follow-up.

Three cases tied to 1 clinic

Three of the new cases involve children all seen at the same clinic in Butanuka district, Beni. Officials said risk of additional cases from the three children—all of whom died—is high. To date, 19 healthcare workers have been infected during this outbreak, and 3 have died.

In its latest situation report on the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday that all healthcare personnel infections have occurred from exposure outside the healthcare setting. As of Oct 7, the WHO said the current outbreak's case-fatality rate is 63.5%, and 55% of cases involve female patients.

""The EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains at a critical juncture due to the prevailing security threats, community reluctance and increased geographical spread. Response teams continue to face challenges that require ongoing community engagement efforts, as well as the ability to adapt strategies according to context,"" the WHO said. ""Collectively, these challenges have contributed to an increase in the incidence of new cases observed in recent weeks.""

The WHO also detailed the surveillance situation in North Kivu, noting that, as of Oct 7, a total of 2,115 contacts were being monitored and 91% had been seen on that date; 202 had not been seen, of which (180) 89% were registered in Beni. Forty contacts have been ""lost to follow-up,"" 37 of whom are from Beni.

Violence and vaccination

The recent increase in cases can be tied to regional insecurity, the WHO said. On Oct 2, a Red Cross team assisting in a safe and dignified burial near Butembo was attacked while working.

""These Red Cross teams have faced incidents of violence from communities resisting safe and dignified burial protocols since the start of the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu province; however, the recent attack represents a new level of aggression,"" the WHO said.

Despite setbacks, a ring vaccination campaign is still under way in the region. As of yesterday, a total of 15,279 people have been vaccinated, including 5,385 in Beni, 4,289 in Mabalako, 1,663 in Mandima, 1,392 in Katwa, 1,100 in Butembo, 434 in Bunia, 355 in Tchomia, 300 in Masereka, 240 in Komanda, and 121 in Oicha.

The new measures come after the International Red Cross last week condemned an attack that injured three of its volunteers who were trying to bury an Ebola victim.

Proper burial of Ebola victims is critical to control the disease, which causes fever, vomiting and diarrhoea and is spread through direct contact with body fluids.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congolese authorities announced a ban on Wednesday on harboring suspected Ebola patients and promised police protection for health workers at burials, in a bid to fight back against local resistance to efforts to combat the disease.

Residents of eastern Congo have attacked health workers and refused to cooperate with government efforts to combat Ebola there, the country’s second major outbreak of the disease this year, which is believed to have killed 118 people since July.

Ebola has spread to Beni, a city of several hundred thousand people where scores of people have been confirmed infected. The authorities worry that without the cooperation of the local population they will have difficulty containing it.

The Health Ministry has been reporting 1-2 new confirmed cases a day in recent weeks, but reported seven late on Tuesday — six in Beni and one in the town of Masereka, 100 km away. It blamed the faster pace on community resistance to measures to fight the outbreak.

Local mistrust and attacks by rebel groups have disrupted treatment and vaccination programs. Beni’s mayor Jean Edmond Nyonyi Bwanakawa told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday the decree banning the harboring of patients would be signed into law later in the day.

The Health Ministry said the decree would impose a jail term of up to three months on those who harbor suspected Ebola patients.

Health professionals who fail to refer a suspected Ebola sufferer to a treatment center will have their own centers shut down. Families will need a death certificate in order to obtain a burial permit, and health workers will be allowed police protection during burials.

Proper burial of Ebola victims is critical to control the disease, which causes fever, vomiting and diarrhea, and is spread through direct contact with body fluids.

The response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is becoming increasingly undermined by security challenges in at-risk areas, particularly Beni. These incidents severely impact both civilians and frontline workers, forcing suspension of EVD response activities and increasing the risk that the virus will continue to spread. WHO continues to distinguish between the incidents of conflict between rebel and government forces, and pockets of community push-back on the response. A recent increase in the incidence of new cases (Figure 1) is the result of the multitude of challenges faced by response teams. This also reflects improved active surveillance and reporting from the community.

Since the last Disease Outbreak News (data as of 2 October), 29 new confirmed EVD cases were reported: 23 from Beni, four from Butembo, one from Mabalako, and one from Masereka Health Zones in North Kivu Province. Fifteen of these confirmed cases have been linked to known cases or were linked retrospectively through case to transmission chains within the respective communities, while fourteen recently reported cases remain under investigation.

As of 9 October 2018, a total of 194 EVD cases (159 confirmed and 35 probable), including 122 deaths (87 confirmed and 35 probable)1, have been reported in seven health zones in North Kivu Province (Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Mabalako, Masereka, Musienene and Oicha), and three health zones in Ituri Province (Mandima, Komanda and Tchomia) (Figure 1). An overall increasing trend in weekly case incidence is seen (Figure 2); however, these rising trends are likely underestimated given expected delays in case reporting, the ongoing detection of sporadic cases, and security concerns which limit contact tracing and investigation of alerts. Of the 194 confirmed and probable cases for whom age and sex information is known, the majority (64%) are within 15-44 years age range. Females (55%) accounted for a greater proportion of cases (Figure 3). Since the last Disease Outbreak News update, one new health care worker infection was reported, bringing the cumulative case count to 20 (19 confirmed and one probable), of whom three have died.

The MoH, WHO and partners continue to closely monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries. As of 9 October, 25 suspected cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are awaiting laboratory testing. Since 4 October, alerts have been investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as in neighbouring countries. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts from neighbouring provinces and countries.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

Surveillance: Over 8000 contacts have been registered, of which 2732 remain under surveillance as of 9 October 2 . Beni Health Zone has the greatest number of contacts (n=1834) and the greatest challenges in contact tracing due to a combination of factors, including: community reluctance and refusal for contact tracing; contacts lost to follow-up; and a deteriorating security situation.

. Beni Health Zone has the greatest number of contacts (n=1834) and the greatest challenges in contact tracing due to a combination of factors, including: community reluctance and refusal for contact tracing; contacts lost to follow-up; and a deteriorating security situation. Vaccination: As of 10 October, 90 vaccination rings have been defined, in addition to 31 rings of health and frontline workers. To date, 15 828 eligible and consented people have been vaccinated, including 6327 health and frontline workers and 3439 children. Vaccination preparedness progress is being made in neighbouring Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda, and Burundi. The Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) managed by the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) in Beni has increased its capacity to 25 beds.

IPC activities are ongoing and are supported by several partners in the field. In Butembo Health Zone, fine-tuning of IPC infrastructure at Matanda Hospital is ongoing alongside follow-up and supervision of pre-triage; IPC construction is estimated to be at least 80% complete at Sainte Famille Hospital. Training on triage and pre-triage took place at Sainte Famille Hospital on 5 October, and three additional structures have been identified for pre-triage support in Butembo.

Risk communication, community engagement, and social mobilization has been integrated with surveillance, contact tracing, and vaccination work as part of a revised strategy to address community concerns about the response. Under this approach, young persons under civil society leaders’ supervision are notified of community alerts, arrive first on-site to engage in dialogue with families, and remain with family members and the response teams to address any concerns or issues. This strategy has been implemented in 12 Beni neighbourhoods and is under consideration for scaling across health zones. Community engagement activities have also been extended to essential groups like women’s groups, taxi drivers, youth groups, and students. Refresher training with community relays and leaders to improve the quality of engagement and community-based surveillance is underway in Beni and Tchomia, with sessions planned in Oicha and Butembo next week.

Red Cross safe and dignified burial (SDB) teams are operational in Mangina, Beni, Oicha and Tchomia; trained teams are on stand-by in Mambasa and Goma. The recent escalation of violence, including an incident resulting in injury to three Red Cross volunteers on 2 October, has resulted in the cessation of Red Cross SDB activities in Butembo until further notice. Civil Protection teams are currently responding to SDB alerts in Butembo. As of 10 October, a total of 236 SDB alerts were received, of which 190 were responded to successfully. Thirty-two responses were unsuccessful due to community refusals or burials conducted prior to the arrival of SDB teams. Seven SDB alerts have not been responded to due to security concerns. Capacity for Beni SDB is being strengthened due to an anticipated increase in alerts, and the mayor of Beni has announced that all deaths must be accompanied by a death certificate. Rapid diagnostic tests are being considered as part of validating hospital and community deaths.

Point of Entry (PoE): A cross-border coordination meeting was held from 2-4 October in Uganda to discuss preparedness and response to the current Ebola outbreak, with representatives from Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania and Kenya in attendance. As of 9 October, health screening has been established at 57 Points of Entry (PoEs) and over 7.7 million travellers have been screened. IOM and PNHF have set a community-based cross-border coordination meeting in Tchomia. Staff from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have deployed to support health screening at 11 operational PoEs in South Sudan.

To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. Among the partners are a number of UN agencies and international organizations including: European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operation (ECHO; International Organization for Migration (IOM); the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF); UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR); World Food Programme (WFP); United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC); UK Public Health Rapid Support Team; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); multiple Clusters, peacekeeping operations and the UN mission; UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS); World Bank and regional development banks; African Union, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and regional agencies; Health Cluster partners and NGOs including ALIMA, ADECO, AFNAC, CARITAS DRC, CEPROSSAN, CARE International, COOPI, CORDAID/PAP-DRC, ICRC, IFRC, Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, INTERSOS, IRC, MEDAIR, MSF, PNHF, Samaritan’s Purse, and SCI; Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), Steering Committee, EDPLN, ECCARN, technical networks and operational partners, and the Emergency Medical Team (EMT) Initiative. GOARN partners continue to support the response through deployment for response and readiness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries and to different levels of WHO.

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country, which borders Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. On 28 September 2018, based on the worsening security situation, WHO revised its risk assessment for the outbreak, elevating the risk at national and regional levels from high to very high. The risk remains low globally. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international travel to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

The group also said response efforts were again interrupted by regional violence.

DRC health officials yesterday confirmed 6 new Ebola cases in the latest hot spot of Beni, including 3 deaths, as the number of suspected cases continues to pile up. Of the 194 total cases, 159 are confirmed and 35 are listed as probable.

In addition, a World Health Organization (WHO) official says the epidemic will likely carry well into 2019.

Officials probe 25 suspected cases

The DRC's health ministry said the 6 new cases in Beni include 3 deaths in the community, a concerning report because it means high levels of exposure to people who cared for the dead. The ministry also noted a death in a previously reported patient.

Health officials are following up on 25 suspected cases, which is up from 20 the day before. The DRC has now reported 29 new cases in just 6 days, or 15% of the total cases in the entire outbreak, which began in August.

The event already ranks as the seventh-largest Ebola outbreak ever. Everyone remembers the colossal 2014-16 outbreak in West Africa, which grew to almost 29,000 cases. But only five other outbreaks have surpassed 200 infections, and they ranged from 224 to 425 cases.

Among them are the very first known Ebola outbreaks. In separate epidemics in 1976, the virus infected at least 284 people in Sudan and 318 in Zaire, which is now the DRC.

The vast majority of new cases in the current DRC outbreak have been in Beni, an area of rebel violence and community resistance to vaccine efforts. Yesterday DRC officials implemented new measures to help slow the outbreak in the region, including making it illegal to harbor suspected Ebola patients and keep them away from Ebola treatment centers.

In-school transmission

New York City–based humanitarian nonprofit the International Rescue Committee (IRC) said today that the disease has now spread in a DRC school. The IRC also noted in a news release that the number of new cases each day has more than doubled since Oct 1, likely spurred by a suspension of response activities late last month in Beni because of rebel violence.

""This is a sign not only that the outbreak is not under control, but that without full engagement from the community, things could get a lot worse,"" said Michelle Gayer, the IRC's senior director of emergency health.

Gayer added, ""We have recently seen the transmission of Ebola within a school, opening up a new front in the fight against the disease."" She expressed deep concern over interruptions in response efforts in Beni.

""We are operating within a highly volatile environment where the security situation continues to deteriorate, threatening the lives and livelihoods of the community and disrupting the response. Programs are again suspended today due to unrest and violence. Each time the Ebola response is interrupted lives are at risk. Teams are not able to trace the contacts of patients, vaccinate those in need and ensure safe burial practices,"" she said.

""We are at a critical moment in the response and our teams are highly concerned that the number of new cases could continue to escalate,"" Geyer said. ""It's vital that over the coming days organizations continue to work alongside the local community to strengthen the relationship and work to increase access to people in need.""

No quick end in sight

Peter Salama, MD, the WHO director of emergency response, told Reuters today that he sees no quick solution to ending the DRC epidemic.

""We anticipate that now we'll be looking at least another 3-4 months in order to really stem this outbreak, with a strong focus in Beni and surrounding areas,"" he said. ""I'd say that's the best case scenario.""

Salama added that the next few days will reveal whether the latest wave in Beni is over, and much depends on the security of responders in the region and the level of community resistance.

""If, however, this peak is accompanied by a peak in insecurity which limits our ability to get to all these cases and their contacts, then we could see a much larger wave building. A lot is depending on that security situation,"" he added.

The WHO said on Thursday that the neighbouring countries are well prepared but have not yet approved the use of a vaccine.

The most concerning area is the city of Beni in the DRC's North Kivu province, where dozens of people who may have been exposed to the disease are hiding from health workers, WHO emergency response chief Peter Salama told Reuters news agency.

Salama also disclosed that the clinical trial of therapeutic Ebola treatment is under discussion and could begin in weeks.

The rate of new Ebola cases has more than doubled since September after rebel violence in northeastern DRC caused response efforts to be briefly suspended, health officials said.

As if to underscore the WHO's concerns, the DRC's health ministry yesterday described how community members stole the body of a woman who died at an Ebola treatment center as she was on her way to the cemetery to be buried, violently chasing off police before changing their mind and returning the body to the cemetery.

Then in its update today, the health ministry said an Ebola illness in someone working at response headquarters in Beni temporarily shuttered the office so that the location could be disinfected.

Cases top 200; latest surge mainly in Beni

Of the 11 new cases reported by the MOH, 6 were reported yesterday and 5 today. Eight are from Beni, plus one each from Masereka, Kalunguta, and Mabalako, raising the overall total to 205 cases, 170 of them confirmed and 35 classified as probable. The case-patient from Kalungata reflects a community death, and 7 other deaths were reported, all in Beni, raising the fatality count to 130.

Health officials are still investigating 32 suspected Ebola infections, which is up from 25 suspected cases 2 days ago.

In its update yesterday, the DRC said that, since early October, a significant rise in the number of new confirmed cases has come mainly from Beni. Of 39 new confirmed cases reported during the first 11 days of October, 32 (82%) were from the city, which has recently experienced conflict between rebel and armed groups, with resulting protests, and pockets of community resistance.

Regarding the cemetery incident, the health ministry said that the response team had made some concessions to the family, allowing a friend to drive the hearse and five family member to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) to carry the woman's casket. As part of the deal with the family, a police vehicle followed the procession to the cemetery.

However, the friend driving the hearse suddenly changed course to take the woman to a family plot in Beni's Butsili district, where young people from the neighborhood violently chased police and took the body. Then the group panicked and returned to the cemetery later in the day, where family members wearing PPE buried the body.

Yesterday several members of the family involved in the incident voluntarily went to Beni General Hospital for vaccination and said no one had manipulated the body between the Ebola treatment center and the cemetery. Officials said the neither the coffin nor the burial bag had been opened. And residents of the neighborhood where police were chased and the woman's body taken held a meeting and apologized to response teams, with the neighborhood's young people promising to not to let the situation happen again.

In today's update, the health ministry said one of the new cases involves a plumber from the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) who was working at the outbreak coordination headquarters in Beni. The plumber is hospitalized at an Ebola treatment center in the city.

Investigators found that the man had stayed at the center of a traditional healer where an earlier confirmed Ebola patient was seen before he or she was taken to an Ebola treatment center. Most of the response team at the MONUSCO office had been vaccinated, but the team had to leave headquarters today so that the entire site could be disinfected.

According to the health ministry, the plumber's coworkers have volunteered to be vaccinated and were put on paid leave for 21 days as a precaution.

Underestimated case totals

In its weekly overview of the outbreak, the WHO said the latest surge in cases reflects complex challenges that responders face, such as conflicts between rebel and government forces and pockets of community push-back. It notes, however, that some of the increase represents improved surveillance and community reporting.

Worryingly, of 29 cases reported since the WHO's last update on Oct 2, 15 were from known transmission chains, but exposures for 14 others are still under investigations. Cases without known links to other patients hint that the disease is circulating undetected in parts of the affected area, posing a high risk of further spread.

The WHO said the latest rise in cases probably underestimates the burden of the disease, given delays in case reporting, ongoing sporadic cases, and security concerns that hamper contact tracing and investigation of possible illnesses.

One more health worker infection was reported since the WHO's last update, raising that total to 20 so far, which includes 3 deaths.

In Butembo, safe burial teams from the Red Cross suspended activities indefinitely, following an Oct 2 attack on volunteers, and civil protection teams are currently handling the burials there. However, 32 of 236 responses were unsuccessful because of community refusal or burials conducted before the teams arrived. Seven alerts weren't answered over security concerns.

Meanwhile, burial team capacity in Beni is being strengthened, because of an expected rise in deaths. The WHO said Beni's mayor recently announced that all deaths must be accompanied by a death certificate, and rapid diagnostic testing is being considered as part of validation for hospital and community deaths.

Oct 11 WHO statement",no result found,no result found,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - A plumber working for the United Nations’ peacekeeping mission in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has tested positive for Ebola, the health ministry said on Friday, the first case of a U.N. worker contracting the disease during the current outbreak.

The plumber is believed to have contracted the virus at a health center in the city of Beni run by a traditional healer where someone with Ebola had sought treatment, the ministry said in a daily bulletin.

The Ebola outbreak in Congo’s eastern borderlands with Uganda and Rwanda has worsened markedly in recent weeks due to community resistance to health workers and insecurity caused by rebel groups active in the area.

The health ministry said five more confirmed cases and five new deaths had been recorded. That brings the total number of deaths to 130 and confirmed or probable cases to 205 since July.

It added that the plumber’s colleagues have registered to be vaccinated on Saturday and have been placed on paid leave for 21 days, the maximum incubation period of the virus.

“A U.N. colleague based in Beni has tested positive for Ebola, and is now receiving the necessary medical treatment,” the head of Congo’s U.N. peacekeeping mission, Leila Zerrougui, wrote in a letter to employees.

She said the employee had not been to work for several weeks and that tracing of the person’s contacts had begun immediately.

U.N. workers have taken an active role in the response to the outbreak, including by providing security to first responders in areas threatened by militia groups.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was forced to withdraw its Ebola experts from an outbreak zone in the Democratic Republic of the Congo several weeks ago amid heightened security concerns, a decision that is fueling worry over the impact on efforts to contain the epidemic, according to U.S. officials and public health experts familiar with the matter.

The Ebola experts — among the most experienced on the planet — and other U.S. government employees have been told by the State Department that they cannot travel to eastern DRC to help with the on-the-ground response.

As a result, Dr. Pierre Rollin — a fixture of Ebola responses for decades — has been consigned to the capital, Kinshasa, more than 1,000 miles away, where he is advising the ministry of health. Other CDC staffers are helping DRC’s eastern neighbors beef up their health security operations and prepare in other ways in case Ebola spreads across DRC’s borders. Some have been detailed to the World Health Organization’s Geneva headquarters.

A number of other organizations — Doctors Without Borders, the International Federation of the Red Cross, the nonprofit medical group Alima — are also assisting the effort to contain the virus.

But the CDC has expertise the response teams need, said Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

“CDC has responded to nearly two dozen filovirus outbreaks in its history and has people who’ve been working on these issues for 30 years. It doesn’t make sense to have those people hundreds or thousands of miles away from where the disease is actually spreading,” Inglesby said.

“It would provide a lot of value to have experienced leaders at CDC who’ve been in the situation before contributing what they can to the larger effort. I think it’s an important moment to think about that,” he said.

A handful of CDC officials were sent to eastern DRC early in the response to the epidemic, which began to spread in July. The agency’s director, Dr. Robert Redfield, briefly visited the region in August, stopping at the response headquarters in the city of Beni.

But the region is effectively a war zone, with over 1 million displaced people and scores of armed rebel groups that wage battle against government troops. A deadly attack on DRC forces near Beni in late August led to an order for U.S. staff to withdraw from the outbreak zone.

Initially they were pulled back to Goma, a large city south of the area where the outbreak is occurring. What was initially thought to be perhaps a temporary situation has become the status quo.

Public health experts familiar with the discussions over whether to deploy U.S. personnel to the outbreak zone said the decisions have been influenced by the long shadow of the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, which killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.

“This outbreak is occurring in a highly insecure environment, which complicates public health response activities,” a State Department official, who spoke on condition he not be named, said Sunday.

It’s unclear whether or when the U.S. experts might be permitted to return to the outbreak zone. Talks are underway to determine whether they may safely do so, sources said.

“The United States remains committed to doing its part to help save lives and control the outbreak as quickly as possible. We continue to provide technical and financial resources to the DRC Government and the World Health Organization,” the State Department officials said.

So far there have been 211 confirmed and probable cases in this outbreak, making it the seventh largest Ebola outbreak on record. Of the total number of cases, 135 have been fatal.

Helen Branswell/STAT

Some public health experts believe that, while the current conditions are indeed dangerous, an out-of-control Ebola outbreak in a war zone would be exponentially more hazardous — and would ultimately require more U.S. responders on the ground in circumstances of even greater peril.

“The risk isn’t going to go away. And the risk of … an Ebola outbreak that can’t be stopped in that part of the world would be profound,” Inglesby said.

Lessons from the disastrous West African outbreak of 2014-2015, which engulfed three countries and reached case counts previously thought to be impossible, should be applied here, he insisted.

“I think there’s pretty wide agreement that if we’d been able to do more earlier, before the summer where things really took off, we may have been able to change the course of that outbreak,” he said. “Early strong public health response is important in keeping things from getting … out of hand and spiraling.”

The West African outbreak, which took over two years to extinguish, mushroomed to nearly 30,000 cases, killing more than 11,000 people in the process. The early mishandling of the outbreak led to multiple commissions of inquiry and to the reorganization of the WHO’s emergency response operation.

“We, the U.S., after the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak led the reorganization of WHO to put WHO in the lead so that they had surge capacity and … the financial resources to get them out into the field right away, authority to overrule the regional and country offices and take the lead in these responses,” noted Jimmy Kolker, a retired U.S. diplomat with years of experience in Africa who is now a non-resident associate at the Center For Strategic and International Studies.

Kolker gave high marks to the efforts of the WHO, saying the revised emergency response system is working. But it relies, he said, on the global health body being able to call on assistance from national public health agencies. CDC experts should be on the ground in Eastern DRC, Kolker said.

The current outbreak is occurring in the province of North Kivu — with some spillover into the neighboring Ituri province — which is on the border with Uganda. Rwanda and South Sudan are close by.

By the time DRC recognized there was an Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, at the end of July, there had already been 43 cases.

But a rapid response involving use of an experimental Ebola vaccine being developed by Merck created hopes that spread might be contained fairly quickly. From about 40 cases a week, the count dropped to about 10 a week in September, Dr. Mike Ryan, assistant director-general of the WHO’s emergency preparedness and response program, said recently.

That progress, however, has been halted. There have been more infections confirmed in the first half of October than in the whole of September. And the WHO is now openly talking about a response operation that will drag into next year.

The DRC ministry of health reported four new cases Sunday. Three were people who died in the community, meaning they were cared for when they were at their most infectious by loved ones who were not wearing the protective garb that prevents transmission.

Officials attribute the rebound in cases to a number of factors. In addition to security conditions making it difficult for responders to operate, community mistrust has led to vaccine refusal in some neighborhoods and the hiding of some infected people.

The longer the outbreak rages, the harder it will be to contain it, experts warn. In recent reports, the WHO and the ministry of health have acknowledged that “contract tracing” is falling behind. That’s the process by which all people who might have been infected by a case are identified, offered vaccine, and monitored during the period in which infection might develop.

Contact tracing allows for the quick isolation of people who become sick. And it allows responders to keep tabs on where the virus is spreading. If contact tracing fails, responders will lose sight of where the virus is transmitting — dangerous in any scenario and much more dangerous in a conflict zone.

“There is a clear risk to not getting involved,” Inglesby warned. “The risk is that the Ebola outbreak spreads in a more dramatic way in conditions that are already dangerous and make it harder and harder to contain.”

On Oct 13, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, the DRC's minister of health reviewed the situation in Beni, and said the second wave of cases seen in recent weeks is not part of the known contacts identified in epidemiologic investigations.

Kalenga did say, however, that authorities were getting more notifications of possible cases, meaning recent efforts to increase surveillance in Beni have proved effective.

Community deaths threaten region

Of the new cases reported yesterday, three were community deaths, which means the deaths occurred outside of a health care facility or an Ebola treatment center.

The DRC said the three deaths involved dignified and secure burials, but community deaths always increase the risk of Ebola transmission, because viral loads often at their highest level at the time of death.

The DRC is continuing to use Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine in a ring vaccination campaign. Since Aug 8, 16,973 people have been vaccinated, including 6,832 in Beni.

Tedros convenes emergency panel

Today the director-general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, announced a meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations, which will take place in Geneva on Wednesday. The goal of the meeting will be to determine if the ongoing situation in eastern DRC constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage the outbreak.

On Sep 28, the WHO raised the risk assessment of national and regional levels from high to very high due to ongoing security challenges in the region.

Today Stat reported that American health personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were pulled from the outbreak zone last month because of local insecurity. According to Stat, the order to remove personnel came from the State Department.

GOMA, Congo (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday it would convene an emergency committee to decide whether Congo’s Ebola outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern as confirmed cases and deaths from the virus spiraled.

The committee of experts may make recommendations to manage the outbreak, which was declared on Aug. 1 and has worsened, with a risk of the virus spreading from northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo into Uganda and Rwanda.

Congo’s health ministry said on Monday that in the past week alone 33 people were confirmed with Ebola virus and 24 of them died.

The ministry said the latest cases were confirmed between Oct. 8 and 14. In total, more than 200 suspected cases of the deadly hemorrhagic fever have been reported in this outbreak, all but a couple of dozen of them confirmed, while some 130 people have died since July.

Ebola spreads through contact with the bodily fluids of its victims. The health ministry said 73 patients had received new experimental treatments. Of them, just over half recovered, 20 were still in hospital and the rest died.

A plumber for the United Nations’ peacekeeping mission in eastern Congo was confirmed to have Ebola on Friday, the first case of a U.N. worker contracting the disease during the current outbreak.","Sponsored by Good morning, folks! Megan here with your daily dose of news in health and medicine. Exclusive: CDC Ebola experts pulled from outbreak zone due to security concerns The CDC was forced to withdraw its Ebola experts from an outbreak area in the Democratic Republic of Congo several weeks ago due to security concerns, STAT's Helen Branswell reports. With more than 1 million displaced people and scores of armed rebel groups battling against government forces, the area is effectively a war zone. After an attack on U.S. peacekeepers in late August, U.S. staff — including some of the world's most experienced Ebola experts — were told they can't help with the on-the-ground response in the area. That's fueling about the effort to contain the epidemic.

What you need to know about Azar's drug price talk The National Academy of Medicine is holding its big annual meeting this week — and all eyes are on HHS Secretary Alex Azar, who is delivering a talk on prescription drug prices this afternoon. Here's what you need to know: The details: Azar is slated to talk about efforts to bring down drug prices. On Friday, Politico reported that the Trump administration is moving forward with a plan to require pharmaceutical companies include the list price of their drugs in advertisements. It’s possible Azar will discuss that proposal today.

The background: The administration has been hashing out the details of this idea since spring. But it’s still not clear how helpful having list prices in ads will be to consumers, since many other factors impact the price a person pays for a drug.

Also on the agenda: Academy members are also meeting for a slew of other talks centered around cancer, from treatment costs and shortcomings in prevention efforts to drug resistance.

FDA hunts for more details on e-cig marketing The FDA is expanding its investigation into how e-cigarette businesses might be illegally marketing their products. The FDA fired off letters to 21 e-cigarette companies — both manufacturers and importers — seeking information about about whether their products were on sale before August 8, 2016. That's the date when the FDA started requiring new or modified products to receive clearance before hitting the market.

Late yesterday afternoon and today the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) announced five more cases of Ebola virus disease in Beni and Butembo, the current epicenter of outbreak activity.

All three cases announced yesterday resulted in community deaths that involved safe and dignified burials in Beni, the country's health ministry said. Today two cases, one each in Beni and Butembo, were reported.

The outbreak total now stands at 216 cases, including 139 deaths. Thirty-two suspected cases are still under investigation.

From Oct 8 to Oct 14, officials reported 33 new confirmed cases, 24 deaths, and 175 suspected cases investigated, the DRC said. That increase represents both the second wave of virus activity in Beni and increased surveillance in the region.

Today the DRC said there are more signs of community involvement in Beni, including people self-reporting to Ebola treatment centers. Officials also said that all contacts of two cases in Tchomia have passed through the 21-day follow-up period without incident. Tchomia is near the Ugandan border, on the shores of Lake Albert.

Yesterday DRC officials said 73 patients have been treated with experimental Ebola treatments, including mAb 114, Regeneron monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, Zmapp, or Regeneron monoclonal antibodies. Of those 73 patients, 32 are cured and have been discharged, 21 have died, and 20 are still hospitalized.

The treatments are being used in conjunction with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine. Since Aug 8, a total of 17,976 people have been vaccinated, including 7,620 in Beni.

Tomorrow the World Health Organization will convene a meeting to determine if the current outbreak warrants the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern.

The announcement was made at the conclusion of 28 days without any new infections, twice the maximum length of the MERS-CoV incubation period. Only one patient was identified in this outbreak, a 61-year old man diagnosed on Sep 8 with MERS-CoV infection after spending 3 weeks on a business trip to Kuwait.

Twenty-one patients who had close contact with the patient all tested negative for the disease, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In 2015, South Korea experienced a MERS outbreak that resulted in 38 deaths and 186 cases.

WHO: Southern Hemisphere flu activity tapering off in most locations

Southern Hemisphere flu activity continues to taper off, except for Southern Africa, where high levels of flu from both influenza B lineages are reported, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest global flu update. As the region nears the end of its typical flu season, flu activity seems to have peaked in Australia and New Zealand without levels passing seasonal thresholds during the entire season.

In some parts of the world, flu levels are on the rise, including in India, where 2009 H1N1 activity is increasing, and in some Southeast Asia locations like Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand. Also, some Caribbean and Central American countries—such as Cuba, Haiti, El Salvador, and Nicaragua—are reporting rising activity.

Northern Hemisphere flu detections remained at interseasonal levels.

Globally, of specimens that tested positive for flu during the last half of September, 84.2% were influenza A. Of subtyped influenza A viruses, 74% were 2009 H1N1. Of characterized influenza B viruses, 49% were Yamagata lineage and 51% were Victoria lineage.

Oct 15 WHO global flu update","At least 33 people have been infected with the deadly Ebola virus in the past week, 24 of which have since passed away, the health ministry of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) said.

According to the ministry, the cases were discovered between October 8 and October 14.

So far, 211 confirmed and probable cases of Ebola have been reported since early July, when the latest outbreak of the disease started, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.

Of those, 138 people have died from the highly deadly hemorrhagic fever.

{articleGUID}

All cases have been found in the northeastern region of the central African country, the WHO has stated.

The latest Ebola outbreak started in July and could go on for another three or four months, the WHO has said.

In recent weeks, the rate of new Ebola cases has more than doubled after rebel violence in northeastern DRC caused response efforts to be briefly suspended, health officials said earlier this week.

Most of the new cases have been in Beni, a city of several hundred thousand people, where experts had to suspend Ebola containment efforts for days after a deadly rebel attack killed 21.

The Congolese army has blamed the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a notorious rebel group, for that attack.

With multiple armed groups active in the region, health officials have said they are effectively operating in a warzone.

In a response to the violence, the government said it would deploy security forces to protect teams transporting the bodies of Ebola victims for burial

Earlier this week, the WHO noted that all of the health workers who have caught Ebola in this epidemic - 19 so far - have been infected outside of hospitals or clinics, meaning that the virus is spreading in the community.

Following the rapid increase in cases in northeastern DRC, the WHO also warned the disease might spread to neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda, adding that those countries are well prepared but have not yet approved the use of a vaccine.",no result found,no result found,no result found

""This does not mean that WHO is not taking the outbreak seriously,"" Robert Steffen, MD, chair of the committee, said during a press conference on the decision. Steffen explained that PHEICs must meet three criteria: they must be extraordinary, pose a risk of international border spread, and require an international response.

Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's deputy director-general of emergency response, said that although this outbreak met some of those criteria, the virus was unlikely to be a major global threat. He also emphasized that the WHO will keep in place 250 health workers currently in-country fighting the disease.

""We considered things like which country is likely to see a case. Uganda is very prepared for an outbreak,"" Salama said, as he explained how the WHO approached the question of international concern.

The WHO continues to deem the DRC outbreak a very high risk at the regional level, the agency said in a news release today.

Four new cases, 3 new deaths

To date, there have been 220 Ebola cases reported in the DRC outbreak, including 142 deaths, the DRC said in an update today. Of those cases, 185 have been confirmed; in addition, 34 suspected cases are under investigation.

The DRC's health ministry reported 4 new cases, 3 of which are in the latest epicenter of Beni. In addition, three patients, all in Beni, died. The case-fatality rate stands at 65% overall, and at 58% among confirmed cases.

Salama and Steffen also said that ongoing security challenges are the biggest issue facing the response efforts. In the last 8 weeks, there have been eight major security incidents, and a recent wave of cases in Beni among people with no known contacts to previous cases is ""of great concern"" according to the WHO release.

Community resistance in Beni has been the focus of WHO efforts in recent weeks. Yesterday on Twitter Salama said the WHO had been successful in tracing 78% of at-risk people and known contacts in Beni, calling the situation ""improving but still a challenge.""

WHO leaders said the use of Merck's experimental Ebola vaccine has been vital in outbreak response, with more than 18,000 people vaccinated so far during this outbreak.

WHO defends US decision

During a question-and-answer session with journalists, WHO leaders defended the United States's decision to pull workers from its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from the area over security issues, saying it was up to each country to determine security risks for their health workers.

But some Ebola experts, such as Ronald Klain, took to social media to make an argument for more American involvement in the outbreak. ""More help from USAID is needed as well, and more US engagement with other nation—and Presidential leadership—is called for,"" he said on Twitter. Klain served as the US Ebola response coordinator in late 2014 into early 2015.

Yesterday, Leila Zerrougui, the head of MONUSCO, the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC, said rebel forces in the outbreak region are getting more and more aggressive, according to Actualite.

North Kivu province is home to more than 1 million displaced people and countless rebel groups.

The Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo is likely to worsen significantly unless the response to it is stepped up, an emergency committee of experts convened by the World Health Organization said on Wednesday.

However, it does not yet constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the emergency committee said.

“The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo, WHO, and partners must intensify the current response. Without this, the situation is likely to deteriorate significantly,” the committee said in a statement.

There have been 139 deaths and 215 probable and confirmed cases in the outbreak, which was declared on Aug. 1. The WHO has said it could spread at any time to neighboring Uganda or Rwanda, although both countries were well prepared.

“We do have some optimism that this outbreak will be brought under control in a reasonable time,” committee chairman Robert Steffen told a news conference at WHO headquarters in Geneva.

Declaring a PHEIC, the first since the Latin American Zika virus outbreak in February 2016, would have ramped up the pace of the response, said Jeremy Farrar, head of Britain’s Wellcome Trust.

“Declaring this could have released more resources, including finance, healthcare workers, enhanced security and infrastructure - as well as more international political support,” he said in a statement.

“Whether it is defined as a PHEIC or not, this epidemic is at a crucial phase and in an incredibly difficult environment.”

But Steffen said there were also disadvantages, such as travel and transport restrictions that could hinder the fight against Ebola. The committee said it was particularly important that no such restrictions were imposed.

Jamie LeSueur, head of the Congo Ebola response operation at the International Federation of the Red Cross, said insecurity was preventing healthworkers from getting to afflicted communities, causing an surge of cases.

“We are concerned that this will contribute to an accelerated spread of the disease, which poses increased risk to neighboring provinces in DR Congo and neighboring countries.”

Steffen said the committee had based its conclusions on three criteria - whether the outbreak was extraordinary, whether there was a risk of international spread, and whether there was a requirement for an international response.

The outbreak was very concerning for the region but not globally, he said, adding that no cases had yet been exported, and the international response was already underway.

“In one of the provinces the outbreak is pretty much mitigated, in another province it is just flaring up, but the concentration of the response teams is now focusing on this new area,” he said.","Sponsored by WHO holds emergency meeting on Ebola outbreak The WHO has convened an emergency committee meeting today at the organization’s headquarters in Geneva to determine whether the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo constitutes a public health emergency that’s of international concern.

18-Oct-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has seen significant improvements over the past weeks, including strong performances by field teams conducting vaccinations, and improved community engagement and risk communication in priority areas. However, as new cases continue to emerge from Beni and appear closer to security ‘red zones’, it is clear that risks remain and that strong response measures need to be prioritized. The virus’ spread is partly due to security conditions that severely impact frontline and health workers, at times forcing the suspension of response activities and increasing the risk that the virus may spread to neighbouring provinces and countries. The MoH, WHO and partners continue to rapidly adapt to these challenging circumstances, scaling up all pillars of the response: surveillance, contact tracing, community engagement, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control, safe and dignified burials, vaccination, and therapeutics.

Due to the challenges faced in Democratic Republic of the Congo, the 1st Meeting of the 2018 International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee for Ebola Viral Disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo took place on 17 October. Due primarily to the strength and tempo of current response operations, it was the view of the Committee that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not been met. The Committee further concluded that the current outbreak has several characteristics of particular concern: the risk of more rapid spread given EVD presence in urban environments; that there are several outbreaks in remote and hard to reach areas; and that health care staff have been infected. Risk of international spread also remains very high due to the outbreak’s proximity to significant regional traffic. Logistical challenges due to poor infrastructure continue to affect surveillance, case detection and confirmation, contact tracing, and access to vaccines and therapeutics.

Despite these challenges, the Committee also noted that the response of the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO, and partners has been rapid and comprehensive. The Committee concluded that interventions already underway provide strong reason to believe that the outbreak can be brought under control, and that this vigorous response should be supported by the entire international community. A decline in the current level of response would cause the situation to deteriorate significantly. It is particularly important that there should be no international travel or trade restrictions, and that neighbouring countries should strengthen both preparedness and surveillance.

Since the last Disease Outbreak News (data as of 16 October), 26 new confirmed EVD cases were reported: 19 from Beni, three from Butembo, one from Mabalako, one from Kalungata, and two from Masereka Health Zones in North Kivu. Five of these confirmed cases have been linked to known cases or transmission chains within the respective communities, while 21 cases remain under investigation.

As of 16 October 2018, a total of 220 EVD cases (185 confirmed and 35 probable), including 142 deaths (107 confirmed and 35 probable)1, have been reported in seven health zones in North Kivu Province and three health zones in Ituri Province (Figure 1). An increasing trend in weekly case incidence has been observed (Figure 2). The rising trends are likely underestimated given expected delays in case reporting, the ongoing detection of sporadic cases, and security concerns which limit contact tracing and investigation of alerts. Of the 211 confirmed and probable cases for whom age and sex information is known, the majority (60%) are within the 15-44 years age range. Females (54%) accounted for a greater proportion of cases (Figure 3). A total of 20 healthcare workers have been affected (19 confirmed and one probable), of whom three have died.

The MoH, WHO and partners continue to closely monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries. As of 16 October, 34 suspected cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are awaiting laboratory testing. Since 11 October, alerts have been investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as in neighbouring countries. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts from neighbouring provinces and countries.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC measures, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

Surveillance: As of 16 October, over 11 000 contacts have been registered, of which 4798 remain under surveillance 2 . Beni Health Zone presents the greatest challenges in contact tracing due to a combination of factors, including: a large and increasing number of contacts; community reluctance and refusal for contact tracing; contacts lost to follow-up; and an unstable security situation. As surveillance activities have been enhanced, responders have seen a significant rise in the number of reported alerts and suspected cases tested each day. Prior to surveillance enhancement (effective 2 October), an average of 26 alerts were issued per day (range 17-47), of which 12 (range 3-23) were validated as suspected cases and tested. Since 2 October, improved surveillance activities have generated an average of 66 alerts per day (range 46-106), of which 24 alerts (range 11-38) were validated each day.

Vaccination: As of 17 October, 106 vaccination rings have been defined, in addition to 34 rings of health and frontline workers. To date, 18 943 eligible and consented people have been vaccinated, including 7134 health and frontline workers and 4495 children. With the help of community support and risk communication efforts, vaccination teams have nearly doubled the number of vaccinated children over the past month (adding 2133 since 19 September, which represents 48% of all EVD-vaccinated children). Overall, vaccination teams have reached an additional 3115 eligible and consented people in the last week alone (10-17 October; 807 of these were health and frontline workers). The past week’s increase almost doubles the average number of persons reached each week (1709, range 1328-2070) between 19 September and 10 October.

Infection Protection and Control (IPC) activities are ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and are supported by several partners in the field. The Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) managed by the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) in Beni has increased its capacity to 41 beds. The International Rescue Committee (IRC), has recently strengthened IPC in Beni General Hospital by increasing the number of dedicated medical and WASH staff, instituting daily mentoring and supervision, and constructing improved medical waste management facilities.

Risk communication, community engagement, and social mobilization continues to improve community ownership of response activities by engaging local leaders and influential community members, such as community chiefs, tradi-practitioners, and civil society organizations, in order to encourage community call-to-action for preventing the spread of EVD and regaining confidence in response organizations. Teams have engaged 66 additional community associations this week who supported response operations in Beni, Butembo, and Mangina. Community dialogue activities continue through house-to-house visits in all affected health zones and community concerns are addressed at ETCs, during vaccination, during safe and dignified burials, at points of entry, during routine surveillance activities, and during the discharge of EVD survivors from the ETC to support their return to the community. Interpersonal communication through house-to-house visits, mass communication through radio and media, and community sensitization activities are ongoing in all affected health zones.

Current safe and dignified burial (SDB) capacity, through Red Cross (RC) and Civil Protection (CP) teams, is operational in Mangina (RC), Beni (RC and CP) Butembo (CP), Oicha (CP), Bunia (RC), and Tchomia/Kasenyi (RC and CP). Trained RC SDB teams in Mambasa and Goma are on stand-by. Security remains a concern in Beni and Butembo; Red Cross SDB activities in Butembo remain suspended until further notice. Training has started for three additional SDB teams. As of 17 October, a total of 280 SDB alerts were received; of these, 232 were responded to successfully. Forty (40) responses were unsuccessful due to community refusals or burials conducted prior to the arrival of SDB teams, and one was pending at the time of reporting. Seven SDB alerts have not been responded to due to security concerns. Civil Protection teams have responded to 41 alerts (31 successfully). Among all SDB alerts, 41% come from communities, 32% from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs), and 27% from other health facilities (non-ETCs).

Point of Entry (PoE): As of 17 October, health screening has been established at 48 Points of Entry (PoEs) and over 9.1 million travellers have been screened. The International Organization for Migration (IOM); continues to support 32 key PoEs in Democratic Republic of the Congo, with flow monitoring at 16 sites; IOM screening protocol requires a health declaration form, temperature check, observation of symptoms (if any), hand washing, and risk communication. Eight priority PoEs have been identified in Ituri Province, and IOM is supporting PoE staff training and the establishment of a coordinating mechanism among PoEs and border facilities. IOM in Uganda is establishing 10 flow monitoring points along the border with South Sudan and Democratic Republic of the Congo and has activated four PoEs in South Sudan’s Yei River State; four additional PoEs are being established in Busia, Tokori, and Livolo and Keriowa.

Partners: To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. Among the partners are a number of UN agencies and international organizations including: European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operation (ECHO; International Organization for Migration (IOM); the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF); UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR); World Food Programme (WFP); United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC); UK Public Health Rapid Support Team; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); multiple Clusters, peacekeeping operations and the UN mission; UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS); World Bank and regional development banks; African Union, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and regional agencies; Health Cluster partners and NGOs including the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA), Adeco Federación (ADECO), Association des femmes pour la nutrition à assisse communautaire (AFNAC), CARITAS DRC, Centre de promotion socio-sanitaire (CEPROSSAN), CARE International, Cooperazione Internationale (COOPI), Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID/PAP-DRC), Harvard Humanitarian Initiative (HHI), International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC Red Cross), International Medical Corps (IMC), Intersos – Organizzatione Umanitaria par l’Emergenza (INTERSOS), International Rescue Committee (IRC), Medair, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Oxfam International, Samaritan’s Purse, Social Science in Humanitarian Action Platform (SSHAP), and Save the Children International (SCI); Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), Emerging and Dangerous Pathogens Laboratory Network (EDPLN), Emerging Disease Clinical Assessment and Response Network (EDCARN), technical networks and operational partners, and the Emergency Medical Team Initiative (EMT). GOARN partners continue to support the response through deployment for response and readiness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries and to different levels of WHO.

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country, which borders Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO’s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international travel to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

In related developments, field teams are making headway in the main outbreak areas in recent weeks, but big risks remain, given continuing cases from Beni and near Kasenyi, which is in a security ""red zone"" and close to internally displaced person camps, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday in its weekly situation report.

Beni cases, plus more community deaths

The new cases lift the overall total to 223, which includes 188 confirmed and 35 probable cases. Also, the health ministry reported two more deaths, raising the fatality count to 144. Both involved people from Beni who died in the community, an event known to increase the risk of spread, but were buried safely.

Health officials are also investigating 46 suspected cases.

In other outbreak developments, DRC Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, traveled to Beni today to unveil a new response plan, based on a review of the strengths and weaknesses during the first 2 months of the response.

Goals of the plan are to step up response capacity targeting active households to stop the epidemic by the end of November, with a further monitoring, prevention, and control phase put in place until the end of January 2019. Some highlights of the new plan include boosting ownership and community engagement, tying the response to local health systems, and preparing other provinces to tackle the possible spread of the virus.

So far 18,998 people have been vaccinated, including 8,422 in Beni.

Security still a problem

The WHO said there's evidence of ongoing transmission in communities, especially Beni. In more than half of new cases, investigations are still under way to establish the epidemiologic links.

Also, searches are being conducted for lost contacts in Beni and Komanda health zones, according to the report.

Security is still a problem for safe burial teams in Beni and Butembo. Also, because of the fragile situation in Butembo (the urban outbreak location), the Red Cross still hasn't fully resumed burial activities since an incident on Oct 2 injured some of its workers.

On a positive note, negotiations with an armed group in a territory where a confirmed case had been lost to follow-up resulted in the group agreeing to allow a response team into the area to administer vaccine. ""This is a critical step forward to reach populations in the red zones,"" the WHO said.

Measles clusters reported in and around New York City

State and local health officials in New York are reporting clusters of measles infections, one in an Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn and the other in Rockland County, a suburb of New York City.

In an Oct 17 statement, NYC Health said six cases have been confirmed this month in the Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn, with the first case a child who contracted the virus on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak is occurring. Patients range from 11 months to 4 years. Five were unvaccinated before they were exposed, four due to delayed vaccination and one who was too young to be vaccinated. The sixth child had received one dose before exposure but was not yet immune.

Some of the children have experienced complications, including a child hospitalized with pneumonia and another who acquired an ear infection.

According to the report, there are seven confirmed measles cases in people from outside of New York City—five who were exposed during travel to Israel and two with secondary infections.

Meanwhile, Rockland County health commissioner Patricia Ruppert, DO, MPH, said in an Oct 17 Facebook post that 11 cases have been confirmed, six of them secondary cases.

NYC health held a meeting in Williamsburg with rabbis and elected officials and will place ads in newspapers to raise awareness and distribute posters to health providers. Rockland County is hosting free measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine clinics.

Group approves for Dengvaxia for use in Europe

The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has recommended Sanofi's Dengvaxia dengue vaccine for approval in Europe.

""This is good news for people living in dengue-endemic parts of the European territories where frequent outbreaks could put them at risk of re-infection with another dengue virus serotype, which is often more severe than the first infection,"" said Su-Peing Ng, MD, global medical head at Sanofi Pasteur, in a press release.

The indication for Dengvaxia is for people living in European territories ages 9 to 45 years of age, who have already had a dengue infection. A person can suffer from several dengue infections throughout their life, as previous infection does not provide immunity.

Dengvaxia was approved for use in 15 countries before the recommendation was made to only use the vaccine in those with prior dengue exposure. In dengue-naive recipients, the vaccine can act as a priming agent that makes subsequent infections more severe.

BSE detected on Scottish farm

Scotland's government yesterday announced that a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has been confirmed on a farm in Aberdeenshire.

In a statement, officials said the Animal Health Agency is investigating the source of the outbreak, which was identified during strict control measures put in place at the farm. They added that the animal did not enter the human food chain and that Food Standards Scotland has confirmed that there is no risk to human health from the isolated case.

All animals over age 4 years that die on farms are routinely tested for BSE under the country's surveillance system. Though the disease isn't directly passed from animal to animal, its cohorts and offspring have been traced and isolated and will be destroyed in line with European Union requirements.

Fergus Ewing, rural economy secretary, said, ""Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.""

BSE, also called mad cow disease, was first detected in 1986 and spread through British cattle herds in the 1980s and 1990s after the cattle ate feed containing protein from infected animals. Consuming meat products from BSE-infected cattle is assumed to be the cause of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the human equivalent of BSE.

Vietnam, Bulgaria report more high path H5 poultry outbreaks

In the latest avian influenza outbreak developments, Vietnam reported a highly pathogenic H5N6 in village poultry and Bulgaria reported two more outbreaks involving H5 viruses, according to reports from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).

Vietnam's outbreak began on Oct 7 in a village in Dak Lak province in the south central part of the country. The event killed 100 of 2,500 birds, and the remaining ones were culled to curb the spread of the virus. Vietnam reported its last H5N6 outbreak in late September, which struck village birds in Cao Bang province in the north.

Elsewhere, Bulgaria reported two highly pathogenic H5 outbreaks, both of which struck commercial poultry farms in Haskovo province in the south. The outbreaks began on Oct 17, killing 7,718 of 146,000 birds at the two facilities. The surviving poultry were destroyed as part of the response steps. The detection follows an Oct 8 report of an H5N8 outbreak in backyard birds in Plovdiv province in the central part of the country.

Oct 18 OIE report on H5N6 in Vietnam

Oct 18 OIE report on H5 in Bulgaria",no result found,no result found,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - The leading Ebola expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday he believed an outbreak in Congo can be brought under control quickly and that the high rate of new cases is due largely to improved detection.

The haemorrhagic fever’s outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo is believed to have killed 144 people since July and infected another 79, and the rate of new cases has accelerated sharply in recent weeks.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said last week it expected the outbreak to last at least three to four more months and possibly to spread to Uganda and Rwanda due to poor security and locals’ mistrust of health workers.

But Pierre Rollins, who has studied Ebola for three decades, said he thought it could potentially be brought under control within a month or two, as authorities expand their tracing of new patients’ contacts.

“We compared the evolution of this epidemic to other epidemics to see if the increase had been more rapid, and there was no difference,” Rollins said in an interview.

“What happened in the last week is that the health ministry has decided ... to research the cases more actively because they would see cases arrive that had no link to patients already treated or registered as known contacts.”

He added that the introduction 10 days ago of a new World Bank-supported program to pay people by mobile phone to report cases has encouraged quicker reporting.

Nevertheless, attacks on health workers have hindered the response and prompted the U.S. government in August to withdraw CDC and USAID workers from the front lines.

Some who stayed in the field have been less upbeat. An emergency committee of WHO experts said on Wednesday that the outbreak was likely to worsen significantly unless the response was stepped up.

Security in eastern Congo is poor due to the presence of dozens of militias that prey on local populations and exploit natural resources.","Epidemiologists working on the world’s latest Ebola outbreak are racing to try to solve a mystery. Why have so many children — some still infants — been infected with the virus?

The disproportionate number of recent infections among children in the Democratic Republic of Congo — specifically in Beni, the outbreak’s current hot spot — has come as a surprise; typically young children don’t make up a big proportion of cases during an Ebola outbreak.

But in the first two weeks of October, nearly 60 percent of the newly reported cases in and around Beni were children under the age of 16, Dr. Peter Salama, of the World Health Organization, told STAT.

“It is unusual for this outbreak and it is unusual in previous outbreaks … to see this proportion of kids,” said Salama, who called it “a very high number.”

The latest situation report from the global health agency noted that of 43 cases reported in early October — there have been more since the report was written — 20 were children. Nine of the children were under the age of 5.

Overall there have been 223 confirmed and probable cases in this outbreak, which is believed to have begun in July. Of those infections, 144 have been fatal.

Salama, who is WHO’s deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response, said epidemiologists in Beni are trying to figure out what’s behind the puzzling phenomenon involving children.

At this point, they have a theory — though Salama stressed that it is only that at this stage.

It is currently peak malaria season in Beni. Children in particular can become severely ill when they contract malaria. And it appears that a lot of the children who contracted Ebola in Beni had recently seen medical practitioners or traditional healers.

If a clinic or traditional healer is treating an undiagnosed Ebola patient, other people also present could become infected. That is believed to have happened recently to a plumber who worked on the U.N. peacekeepers’ compound at Beni.

It’s also possible that children who were brought for care for malaria might have received a therapy — something injectable — that could explain the exposures, Salama said.

“It’s a working theory at the moment and we’re trying to get to the bottom of it over the next couple of days,” he said of the malaria hypothesis.

Some of the children have died at home, which puts the family members who looked after them at grave risk. But others have been brought to Ebola treatment centers, Salama said.

The emergency medical response group Alima is operating the Ebola treatment center at Beni and, for the first time in an Ebola outbreak, has started to use an innovative new approach to build community trust and encourage people to bring sick loved ones in for care, Salama said.

That approach is built around a cube — a contained, clear enclosure in which a patient receives care. Medical personnel remain outside the cube, but can reach inside through gloved ports to deliver care. (They don’t need the multiple layers of protective equipment that make them look more alien than human.)

The emergency medical response group Alima is using specially designed cubes to deliver care to patients. Nyka Alexander/WHO

“From the perspective of family engagement and family understanding of what’s happening, I think they’ve been an extremely important advance,” Salama said. “I don’t have scientific evidence for that, but certainly anecdotally I think that’s helping a lot with family members feeling more confident that they know what’s happening and they can stay engaged with their loved one.”

There is still community resistance, however. And that, combined with security problems, have resulted in a worrying turn of events: It’s becoming more and more difficult for the responders to follow the Ebola chain of transmission. Knowing where the virus is spreading is critical to controlling an outbreak.

Over the past three or four weeks, a growing proportion of cases have been people who were not identified as contacts of previous cases. And increasingly, even retrospective attempts to figure out how these people became infected are failing to chart the links. “That’s extremely concerning,” Salama said.

Response coordinators are exploring the possibility of using rapid genome sequencing of viruses to try to bolster their flagging surveillance efforts, he said. Comparing the genetic blueprint of a virus to others in the outbreak can show if a new infection is part of an established chain of transmission, or is perhaps a sign other transmission chains have been spreading disease undetected.

“Given that we’re struggling now because of security to be able to keep track of the chain or chains of transmission, having that added reassurance from the genetics would be another data point,” Salama said.

The WHO is discussing the issue with the ministry of health, looking for agreement. Salama said the country’s national laboratory, the National Institute of Biomedical Research, believes it has the capacity to do the work.

If that doesn’t work, there are other options, Salama said. “There’s a lot of groups that want to support us on this, and we think it’s another good innovation.”"

The World Health Organization said Wednesday the growing Ebola outbreak in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo does not currently constitute a global health emergency.

The decision was made on the advice of a panel of international experts, called an emergency committee, that was convened to advise WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on the issue.

It’s the second time this year that a so-called emergency committee has decided that an Ebola outbreak did not meet the criteria to declare a public health emergency of international concern — a PHEIC in WHO parlance. The earlier time was during a previous Ebola outbreak in western DRC that started in April and was contained by July.

Committee chair Dr. Robert Steffen said the 11-member panel concluded that the international community’s response to the outbreak was adequate at this point. There was nothing to be gained from declaring a PHEIC, and potentially some problems triggered by doing so, Steffen said.

“We thought there was really no added value,” said Steffen, a professor of epidemiology and infectious diseases prevention at the University of Zurich.

He suggested some countries might use the declaration of a PHEIC as an excuse to bar travel from DRC or the region.

In fact, one of the rationales for deploying a PHEIC, a tool of the International Health Regulations, is to tell countries they should not impose trade or travel restrictions during outbreaks because they discourage countries with outbreaks from reporting them and can hinder response operations.

Professor Lawrence Gostin, faculty director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown, said he believed the committee made the wrong call. Declaring a PHEIC would have led to the mobilization of more resources, he said.

In particular, Gostin said the response teams in this outbreak need additional protection, functioning as the response teams are in a conflict zone.

The outbreak is occurring in North Kivu, a province in northeastern DRC that is effectively a war zone. Scores of rebel groups operate in North Kivu, complicating the work of the Ebola response teams and putting their personal security at risk.

“The WHO has neither the mandate nor the expertise to deal with security threats,” Gostin said. “The United Nations needs to train and deploy peacekeepers in support of a public health mission. Without security protection, conflicts and public distrust will propel this Ebola outbreak, and threaten public health responses in the future.”

Ron Klain, a Washington lawyer who served as President Barack Obama’s “Ebola czar” during the unprecedented West African outbreak in 2014-2015, also suggested more help is needed. Klain said the decision not to declare the outbreak a PHEIC should not be read as an encouraging signal.

“It is time for the global community — especially the United States — to step up their efforts in this outbreak,” Klain said.

Currently U.S. government employees — including highly experienced Ebola experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — are being barred from traveling to the outbreak zone. The State Department has deemed the conditions on the ground too dangerous for U.S. employees.

As of Wednesday, there were 220 confirmed and probable cases in this outbreak, the seventh largest on record. Of those people,142 have died.

The WHO has warned that the risk of the virus spreading to DRC’s eastern neighbors is “very high” but that the risk of spread outside the region remains low. The CDC and others have been working with DRC’s eastern neighbors to prepare them to be able to respond quickly if transborder spread occurs.

The outbreak, which may have started in July and was first recognized at the end of that month, appeared to be coming under control in September. But in late September the security situation worsened, limiting the surveillance and containment work the response teams could conduct. That and other problems have led to a recent sharp increase in cases.

There have been more cases in October so far — 59 as of Tuesday — than in the entire month of September. In fact, about one-quarter of the cases in this outbreak to date have been reported in October."

The Allied Democratic Forces rebels attacked Congolese army positions and several neighbourhoods of Beni in the DRC on Saturday and into Sunday, a senior army official told The Associated Press.

The rebels have killed hundreds of civilians in recent years and are just one of several rebel groups active in the DRC's far northeast.

Child kidnappings for ransom are a relatively new phenomenon in the North Kivu region, where Beni is located, making exact figures on the issue difficult to find.

At least 215 children were abducted in the province and 34 killed in North Kivu in 2017, according to a child protection group cited by The Guardian.

Angry over this latest attack, Beni residents on Sunday morning carried four of the bodies to the town hall, where police dispersed them with tear gas.

Late last month, Ebola outbreak containment efforts had to be suspended for days in Beni after a deadly rebel attack, deeply complicating work to find and track suspected contacts of infected people.

Since then, many of the new confirmed Ebola cases have been reported in Beni as the rate of new cases overall has more than doubled.

This new attack comes as another armed group shot and killed two medical agents with the DRC army - the first time health workers have been killed by rebels in this Ebola outbreak.

It is a ""dark day"" for everyone fighting the deadly virus, the DRC health minister said late on Saturday.

Mai Mai rebels surged from the forest and opened fire on the unarmed agents with the army's rapid intervention medical unit at an entrance to Butembo city, the health ministry said.

The daytime attack appeared premeditated, with civilians present left unharmed, the statement said. The medical agents had been placed in ""dangerous zones"" to assist national border health officials.

Aid under fire

Confirmed Ebola cases have now reached 200, including 117 deaths. Aid groups have expressed alarm after the insecurity and sometimes hostile community resistance led the rate of new cases to more than double this month.

Health workers in this outbreak, declared on August 1, have described hearing gunshots daily, operating under the armed escort of UN peacekeepers or Congolese security forces and having to end work by sundown to lower the risk of attack.

The DRC health ministry has reported ""numerous aggressions"" against health workers, and early this month two Red Cross volunteers were severely injured in a confrontation with wary community members in a region traumatised by decades of fighting and facing an Ebola outbreak for the first time.

""Health agents are not a target for armed groups,"" Health Minister Oly Ilunga said. ""Our agents will continue to go into the field each day to fulfil the mission entrusted to them. They are true heroes and we will continue to take all necessary measures so that they can do their job safely.""

On Wednesday, the World Health Organization said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the outbreak but that it does not yet warrant being declared a global emergency.

An outbreak must be ""an extraordinary event"" that might cross borders, requiring a coordinated response. Confirmed cases have been found near the heavily travelled border with Uganda.

In the latest sign of the rumours that pose another serious challenge to containing the deadly virus, the health ministry said 22 youth in Butembo dug up the body of an Ebola victim and opened the body bag, ""wanting to verify that no organs had been taken from the body by health workers"".

They ended up touching the highly infectious bodily fluids, the ministry said. ""The next day, they agreed to be vaccinated,"" joining the more than 20,000 people who have received vaccinations so far.",no result found,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - Unidentified gunmen killed at least 14 people, including two health workers, on Saturday in an area of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where militia violence has hampered efforts to contain an Ebola outbreak, authorities said.

The latest outbreak of the deadly disease in Congo has killed 152 people, mostly in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces that have been the epicenter of armed rebellion and ethnic killing since two civil wars in the late 1990s.

The number of cases has accelerated in the past two weeks and an emergency committee of World Health Organization experts on Wednesday said that the outbreak was likely to worsen significantly unless the response was stepped up.

Eleven civilians and one soldier were killed in the city of Beni, where scores of people have contracted the virus, Alloys Mbwarara, mayor of Beni’s Rwenzori neighborhood, told Reuters on Sunday.

In the city of Butembo, 50 km south of Beni, militiamen killed two members of the medical unit of Congo’s army, Health Minister Oly Ilunga said on Saturday.

“It’s a sad day for all response teams who sometimes put their life in danger while serving the country. Health workers should not be a target for armed groups,” he said.

It is unclear who carried out the attacks. The Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan Islamist group active in eastern Congo, has clashed with Congolese troops in Beni in recent weeks. Mai Mai militiamen, comprising a number of armed bands that originally formed to resist Rwandan invasions in the 1990s, are also present in the region.

Fuelling tension in the cities are local mistrust and attacks by rebel groups that have disrupted treatment, burials and vaccination programs in recent weeks.

As a result of Saturday’s killings, protests erupted across Beni on Sunday morning, said Safari Mambueni, the city’s police commander. The extent of the violence was unclear.

The health ministry said that in Butembo a group of 22 men dug up the body of an Ebola victim to make sure organs had been removed from the corpse by the health workers, in doing so entering into contact with bodily fluids of the victim.

According to a report from Voice of America (VOA), Allied Democratic Forces rebels attacked Congolese army personnel and several neighborhoods in Beni on Saturday and into Sunday. At least a dozen civilians were killed, and 12 children abducted in the Rwenzori neighborhood. On Sunday people took to the streets to protest the growing violence.

In a separate attack, two medical workers with the Congolese army were shot dead by Mai-Mai militiamen from the Vulindi entry point, located at the entrance of the city of Butembo, the DRC health ministry said in an update on Oct 20.

Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, the health minister of the DRC, said in the Oct 20 update, ""It is a dark day for all the teams of the response that sometimes put their lives in danger in the service of the Nation. Health workers are not a target for armed groups.""

Violence could slow response again

Last month, an attack in Beni suspended outbreak response efforts for almost a week, which enabled several transmission chains to go undetected. The lapse in surveillance caused a second wave of the virus that is still wreaking havoc in Beni and Butembo.

""This latest attack is the 10th major incident of insecurity in or around Beni the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak in the past 2 months. A double tragedy for the civilians there as it will be very hard to stop the outbreak if this violence continues,"" said Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's deputy director-general of emergency response, on Twitter.

Also over the weekend, the DRC health ministry said that 22 young people in Butembo dug up the body of an Ebola patient and opened the body bag to make sure that no organs had been taken from the body, which is a rumor plaguing some neighborhoods in that city.

The ministry said the young people touched highly infectious bodily fluids, likely exposing themselves to Ebola. All 22 people agreed to get vaccinated.

As of yesterday, more than 20,000 people in the DRC had been vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine, including 9,823 in Beni and 1,085 in Butembo.

EU releases more money for outbreak

Today the European Union (EU) announced it was releasing €7.2 million ($8.25 million) more to the DRC to fight the outbreak, bringing the total EU response to €12.83 million ($14.7 million) in 2018.

""Overall EU support includes technical expertise, humanitarian air service, research funding and humanitarian assistance,"" said Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides in a press release.

""We are working closely with the World Health Organisation and the national authorities to fight the disease. We are not letting our guard down and we will continue our support for as long as it takes.""

There have been 235 confirmed and probable cases in the outbreak, including 152 deaths. Here's what you need to know: Rebels killed 15 civilians and abducted a dozen children in an attack this weekend in Beni, a city at the center of the Ebola outbreak. The news follows on the heels of an attack in Beni late last month that forced officials to suspend Ebola response efforts for several days, hampering the effort to stem the spread of the virus.

On Saturday, health officials announced that rebels killed two medical agents who were working with the Congolese army to support the Ebola response. “Health workers are not a target for armed groups,” health minister Dr. Oly Ilunga said in a statement.

Health officials also reported that a gang of young men exhumed the body of someone who had died from Ebola after hearing rumors that responders had taken the body. They came into contact with body fluids and agreed to be vaccinated. Judge could decide today on whether to call for new Roundup trial A San Francisco judge is slated to make a final decision today about whether to toss out part of a jury's $289 million award to a school groundskeeper who claimed Monsanto's Roundup weedkiller contributed to his cancer. Dewayne Johnson was one of hundreds of plaintiffs who have sued Monsanto over claims that Roundup — which contains the chemical glyphosate — could cause cancer and that the company didn't adequately warn consumers about that risk. But experts say the science on glyphosate and cancer risk is far from settled. Judge Suzanne Bolanos has suggested she may overturn the $250 million in punitive damages, cut down the remaining reward, and call for a new trial. Cancer researchers report on experimental drugs and clinical trial barriers Cancer researchers presented a slew of new findings at the European Society for Medical Oncology conference over the weekend. Here’s a breakdown of the big news: Merck's cancer drug data: Merck released data that showed an early-stage, immune-boosting drug wasn’t able to kill cancer cells on its own. But when used in combination with the company's drug Keytruda, tumors got smaller in a handful of patients. More on that here.

Immunotherapy and breast cancer: For the first time, a new study of an existing immunotherapy drug — used in combination with chemotherapy — shows it holds promise against an aggressive type of breast cancer. But the benefit was modest, and experts raised questions about the drug’s cost and possible side effects.

Clinical trial barriers: A review of clinical trials found that there are still barriers that prevent teens and young adults with cancer from participating in research, including age minimums and caps in some studies. Inside STAT: How doctors raced to stop a young girl's rare disease Mila was just six years old when she was diagnosed with Batten's disease, a rare neurodegenerative disorder that is always fatal. But her parents, Julia Vitarello and Alek Makovec, now have a glimmer of real hope. With the help of scientists, regulators, and Mila’s family, an experimental therapy — developed in record time — now holds the potential to stop her disease in its tracks roughly a year after she was diagnosed. Her case serves as a proof-of-concept case study in the effort to rapidly develop and deliver precision therapies that are tailored to a particular patient. STAT's Meghana Keshavan has the story here. Severe mental health issues tied to higher ER use Patients with a mental health condition are more likely to use the ER than the general population — and a new study of California hospital data from 2012 to 2014 teases out the role that the severity of a condition might play. The researchers found mild mental health diagnoses were associated with a 3 percent increase in ER use, while moderate and severe diagnoses were associated with 12 and 23 percent increases in ER use, respectively. And while the authors say their findings are likely relevant in other parts of the country, the study is particularly pertinent for California, where the state’s Medicaid program has made big changes to how it delivers mental health care. City health officials call for more disease detectives Health directors of big cities across the country say they need far more epidemiologists to deal with the challenges posed by public health emergencies, citing findings from a new survey of 27 city health departments. Epidemiologists are scientists tasked with tracking disease outbreaks. The survey — coordinated by the Big Cities Health Coalition and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists — found that there are often far fewer epidemiologists for the size of a city than state staffing ratios recommend. “Some cities are woefully under-resourced,” the authors write. “Even in well-staffed departments, there is a perceived need for a significant increase in capacity.” What to read around the web today The Trump administration is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological, immutable condition.

Also, the World Health Organization (WHO) detailed renewed concerns about fresh violence undermining the response and the increasing numbers of Ebola infections in children.

Cases in Beni surpass 100

Of the six new confirmed cases reported today, two involved patients who died in the community, which raise the risk of further spread, given that viral loads are highest when the illness is severe and at the time of death and that people who die outside of health settings were likely to have been cared for by family members and others who weren't adequately protected.

Getting sick people into isolation and treatment is a key part of the outbreak response, and continued reports of community deaths are a sign that responders are having a tough time identifying all active transmission chains.

The 6 new cases boost the outbreak total to 244 cases, including 209 confirmed and 35 probable cases. The new deaths bring the fatality total to 155.

In its daily update, the health ministry said cases in Beni health zone now stand at 102.

As feared following another round of rebel violence over the weekend, immunization activities in Beni are slowing owing to insecurity in some parts of the city, according to the health ministry. So far, 20,939 people have been vaccinated, including 9,853 in Beni.

Security challenges, illnesses in children

In its regular situation report, the WHO said top concerns are the spike in cases over the past 4 weeks, especially in Beni, and the security challenges response teams are facing in Beni and Butembo.

""Continued security incidents severely impact both civilians and frontline workers, forcing suspension of EVD response activities and increasing the risk that the virus will continue to spread,"" it said. Vaccination in Beni could not take place in Beni on Oct 21 because of community demonstrations in the wake of attacks the day before, the WHO added. It also said investigations continue into the steady stream of confirmed cases that aren't from known transmission chains, a sign that the virus continues to spread undetected.

According to a Stat report today, the increasing number of cases confirmed in patients who aren't on known contact lists threatens measures to contain the outbreak and undermines the effectiveness of the vaccine campaign, which depends on a ring-based strategy to vaccinate contacts of confirmed cases and their contacts.

Also, the WHO said recent cases from Beni include a disproportionate number of illnesses in children age 16 and younger. Of 70 cases reported since Oct 1, 30 (43%) involved children, 13 of them infants and kids younger than 5. The agency added that investigations are under way to identify the sources of infection in children and to interrupt transmission.

In another development, the WHO said Ebola was confirmed in a health worker from Beni on Oct 20, raising the total number of healthcare workers infected in the outbreak to 21, 20 of the cases confirmed. Three health workers have died from their illnesses.

CDC director pushed to keep Ebola experts on-site

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield, MD, said he tried to make the case to keep US experts in the outbreak zone but was overruled by Trump administration officials due to security concerns, Stat reported today.

According to earlier reports, the State Department recommended that the CDC experts be withdrawn, which occurred several weeks ago.

Redfield told Stat during the opening session of the Milken Institute Future of Health Summit that he believes health officials are at a disadvantage not having CDC expertise on the ground in the DRC and that he'd like to see a ""small footprint of CDC employees there.""

With vaccine in hand, Ebola response teams are struggling to track those who need it

The Ebola response teams in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are having increasing trouble keeping track of where the virus is spreading, a problem that threatens containment efforts and undermines the effectiveness of the vaccination program there.

Public health officials had been hopeful that an experimental vaccine could help curb the spread of the outbreak. But, for that to happen, response teams must be able to identify people who have been in contact with Ebola patients. Persistent violence in the outbreak zone has made that hard to do.

More than half of the recently detected cases haven’t been on lists of contacts. And even retrospective detective work is failing to piece some of these people into the transmission chain, the World Health Organization acknowledged.

advertisement

“We have a number of indicators right now showing that our ability to quickly detect cases and follow up on their contacts has been seriously challenged by the safety issues,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, who has been tracking the epidemic.

Vaccine, he said, “can’t be given to people you don’t know exist.”

The severe insecurity problems in North Kivu, the province in northeastern DRC where Ebola is spreading, are throwing up major challenges for the outbreak response. There have been repeated attacks by rebel forces on Beni, the current Ebola hot spot, stymying efforts to track Ebola patients and their contacts.

The further behind the virus that the response teams get, the more difficult it will be to use the still-unlicensed vaccine, made by Merck, to its maximum effect, experts acknowledged.

The response team in North Kivu has vaccinated a prodigious number of people — more than 20,000 so far in the province and in parts of neighboring Ituri province, where a few cases have occurred. That count rises by hundreds of people most days.

“It’s extremely impressive,” Anne Rimoin, an associate professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health, told STAT.

But vaccination efforts were not conducted Monday in Beni, after the weekend’s violence there.

So far there have been 238 confirmed and probable cases reported in this outbreak and 155 deaths.

As gaps grow in the response team’s understanding of where the virus is circulating and who has been exposed, the capacity of the vaccine to contain the outbreak diminishes. Osterholm explained the problem as if it were an equation.

Conventional Ebola control measures — isolating the sick, identifying and monitoring the health of contacts of cases, and isolating them if they become symptomatic — are variable A in the equation. On their own, these measures have contained decades of Ebola outbreaks in the past.

But then along came vaccine, variable B in the equation. The Merck vaccine was proved to work during the West African outbreak of 2014-2015 and was first used as a containment tool in an outbreak in western DRC this past spring. That outbreak was brought under control fairly rapidly.

A plus B should lead to containment of the outbreak, potentially faster than in outbreaks past. But if A falters, B — the vaccine — can’t do the job on its own, Osterholm said. “It only works when you get it to the people who need it,” he said.

That’s because of ring vaccination, the type of vaccination strategy being deployed in North Kivu. It was used in the successful smallpox eradication campaign of the 1960s and 1970s.

The idea behind the strategy seems simple: Rather than trying to vaccinate everyone in a place where Ebola is spreading, focus on the people who are at risk of actually contracting the disease. Beni is a city of more than 200,000 people, but only a tiny fraction of them would have been exposed to the virus up to this point.

The goal is to throw up a wall of immunity that Ebola cannot scale.

But effective contact tracing is required to draw up the list of people who should be offered vaccine. And increasingly, contact tracing isn’t identifying all of the at-risk people.

Since the beginning of October, a period during which cases have surged, a growing proportion of new cases in Beni have come from outside the contact lists and can’t be fitted into the chain of transmission, said Dr. Peter Salama, the WHO’s deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response.

The contract tracing performance is measured in percentages — the proportion of known contacts that are followed up daily. Ideally that figure should be in the mid-to-high 90s. And it has generally been that high elsewhere in North Kivu, said Salama.

But in Beni, it has been highly variable, he said, adding that after episodes of violence, the contact tracing performance at Beni has dipped to 30 percent or 40 percent.

The longer contact tracing flags, the more likely it is that the percentage of people being missed grows in an invisible fashion.

Rimoin, who has a long-standing research project in DRC, knows the difficulties the responders face. “The area in which this outbreak has emerged is a very difficult and complex place to have to do this work — to do any work. But to have to combat Ebola in this area is mindbogglingly difficult,” she said.

Last week a panel of international experts who reviewed the outbreak and the response to date suggested that the WHO consider adapting the vaccination strategy, moving to a more geographic approach — vaccinating whole neighborhoods rather than just health care workers, contacts, and contacts of contacts.

Salama told STAT that approach comes with its own challenges. Merck has committed to maintaining a supply of 300,000 doses of the vaccine at all times and has been making additional vaccine as it ships doses to the DRC. So far in 2018, the company has shipped more than 32,000 doses of vaccine, said Pamela Eisele, a spokesperson for Merck.

While 300,000 doses seems like a substantial supply, Salama said he worried using the vaccine geographically could draw down the stockpile quickly. He noted the WHO has to also consider what might happen if this outbreak spreads into neighboring Uganda — which is expected to soon start vaccinating health care workers in locations where cross-border cases might turn up — or Rwanda or South Sudan.

Vaccinating all of Beni, for instance, would make a huge dent in the global stockpile, which would take time to replenished. “So obviously we have to just continue to ration it, according to the best evidence,” he said.

Salama also said he is concerned a geographic approach to vaccination might not solve the underlying problem — the fact that some people in the outbreak area continue to resist all of the control measures the responders use.

“If your high-risk contacts are actively avoiding follow-up or vaccination or care, they’re going to avoid vaccination or geographic targeting strategy presumably as well,” he said. “So you might end up thinking you’ve got great coverage geographically, but you’ve missed the same high-risk contacts that we’re unable to follow up on now. So it will have very limited impact in that sense.”"

New Jersey adenovirus outbreak kills 7 at pediatric hospital

The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDH) said an adenovirus outbreak at a pediatric rehabilitation hospital sickened 18 patients and killed 7.

In a statement yesterday, the NJDH said The Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Haskell is not admitting any new patients until the outbreak is over. At that time, 6 patients had died from their infection. In an update today, the department said another child who was hospitalized because of an adenovirus infection has died, raising the number of deaths to 7.

State health officials have been at the facility since Oct 21, when an inspection team found minor handwashing deficiencies. The NJDH said it working closely with the facility on infection control issues.

Adenoviruses typically cause mild symptoms, especially in young children. However, the outbreak strain—adenovirus 7—is affecting medically fragile children who have severely compromised immune systems. ""The strain has been particularly associated with disease in communal living arrangements and can be more severe,"" the health department said.

Adenoviruses are common in places that house large groups of children, such as child care centers, schools, and summer camps, according to a backgrounder from the NJDH. The viruses are very contagious and can be spread to others by close personal contact, coughing or sneezing, and touching contaminated surfaces. Patients can experience a range of symptoms, including cold-like symptoms, sore throat, bronchitis, pneumonia, diarrhea, pink eye, fever, bladder infection, gastrointestinal inflammation, and neurologic conditions.

ACIP approves hepatitis A vaccine recommendation for homeless

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) vaccine advisory group today approved a recommendation for routine hepatitis A vaccine for all people experiencing homelessness.

In a unanimous vote, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) approved the measure, which applies to all homeless people age 1 and older with a two-dose recommendation to prevent the disease.

The new recommendation comes in the wake of investigations by the CDC and state health departments into hepatitis A outbreaks in several states. Some of the hardest hit-states include California, Utah, Missouri, Arkansas, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Massachusetts.

In June, the CDC issued a Health Alert Network notice that said from January 2017 to April 2018 it had received more than 2,500 reports of hepatitis A associated with person-to-person transmission from multiple states. Of 1,900 reports that listed known risk factors, 1,300 (68%) reported injectable drug use, homelessness, or both. Ongoing outbreaks led to increased vaccine use, which put pressure on supplies. The CDC added, however, that the available stocks improved as some jurisdictions made progress controlling outbreaks, and it and manufacturers are closely monitoring the demand.

A recommendation for hepatitis A vaccination in people who use injections and other drugs has been in place since 1996. Outbreaks of hepatitis A in homeless populations had been reported in other countries before, but not in the United States, the CDC said.

Hepatitis A transmission in people who report drug use or homelessness can result from contaminated needles or other injection equipment, specific sexual contact or practices, or from poor sanitary conditions, said the CDC, which typically adopts ACIP recommendations.

Study: 26% of online HPV messaging has information on cancer prevention

A new content analysis of messaging for the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine showed that most online information about the vaccine was long (44 words or more) and was written at a high reading level. The study was published in Vaccine.

Two independent reviewers analyzed 267 unique messages about HPV vaccination in the fall of 2016 gathered from government websites, medical professional sites, and educational material clearinghouses.

They found only 32% of messages were shorter than 25 words, and 12% had a readability at or below grade 6. Messages about cancer prevention were present 26% of the time, while 62% of messages attempted to address common parent questions and concerns.

""Messages were markedly varied but the majority were [sic] generally long and would not be easy for most people to read,"" the authors concluded.

In 2016, only 66% of 13- to 17-year-olds in the United States had initiated HPV vaccination, and only 49% had completed the multi-dose series, which is far short of the national Healthy People 2020 goal of 80%.

25-Oct-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

Security incidents over the past week, ranging from clashes between rebel and government forces resulting in civilian deaths to response vehicles being pelted with stones, continued to cause community distress and severely impede response activities for the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These incidents are occurring amidst intense EVD transmission in communities in the city of Beni. In spite of these challenges, the Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners are reinforcing efforts to contain the outbreak; WHO does not currently plan to reduce the response team comprised of over 250 WHO staff.

Since the last Disease Outbreak News (i.e. during 16–23 October), 27 new confirmed cases were reported: 24 from Beni (including one resident of Mandima who was hospitalized in Beni), and three from Butembo. Of the newly reported cases, eight were known contacts of previously confirmed cases at the time of reporting, two were linked retrospectively to transmission chains, and 17 remain under investigation. A health worker from a community health post in Beni was among the newly infected; 21 health workers have been infected to date, of whom three have died.

As of 23 October 2018, 247 EVD cases (212 confirmed and 35 probable), including 159 deaths (124 confirmed and 35 probable)1, have been reported in seven health zones in North Kivu Province and three health zones in Ituri Province (Figure 1). Sixty-five cases have recovered, been discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) and reintegrated into their communities. Trends in weekly case incidence and the secondary peak observed earlier this month reflect the intensity of transmission in and around Beni (Figure 2). These trends must be interpreted cautiously given the persistently long delays between illness onset and reporting of cases, and the ongoing challenges in investigating this outbreak.

Risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains very high with ongoing transmission in communities in North Kivu. Enhanced efforts are needed to ensure areas beyond the main affected health zones are prepared and operationally ready to rapidly detect, investigate and respond to any such exportations of the virus. Over the course of the past week, alerts have been reported from Mauritania, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, and the United Republic of Tanzania. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all these alerts from neighbouring provinces and countries.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

Surveillance : As of 23 October, over 11 000 contacts have been registered, of which 5723 remain under surveillance 2 . Follow-up rates over the past week ranged from 85-97% across all health areas. At present, Beni Health Zone presents the greatest challenges in contact tracing due to a combination of factors, including the unstable security situation. As surveillance activities have been enhanced, responders have seen a significant rise in the number of reported alerts and suspected cases tested each day. During 16-23 October, an average of 116 alerts (range 75-159) were reported, of which 35 alerts (range 7-48) were validated as suspected cases for testing each day. Investigations are ongoing for all recently reported cases to elucidate the chains of transmission to interrupt the spread of the virus.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO continue to support the Border Health programme of the MoH in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As of 23 October, 44 of the 64 PoEs were functional due to security incidents, in particular in Beni, and a strike by health personnel at PoEs in Ituri Province. With support from IOM, 16 National Program of Hygiene at Borders (PNHF) supervisors will be deployed as of 23 October to North Kivu and Ituri, with the aim of supporting coordination and capacity building at PoEs. IOM-supported population mobility mapping was finalized in in Tchomia and Kasenyi, and five additional PoEs will be established. IOM also supports four PoEs in bordering areas of South Sudan; as of 21 October, 9955 individuals have passed through these POEs. US CDC also supports PoE activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan.

Laboratory capacity : Diagnostic testing capability has continued to expand as cases spread to new geographic areas. Five field Ebola laboratories providing near-patient testing have been established in Beni, Mutembo, Goma, Mangina and Tschomia; these are in addition to the national laboratory in Kinshasa. Testing volumes have increased in the past week; 337 samples tested in the week ending 21 October which is 30% more than the previous week. Notably, testing of oral swabs from community deaths has increased by 44% and was responsible for detection of a third of all new confirmed cases in the past week. Testing of deceased persons will be scaled up. Rapid diagnostic testing that can be performed at gravesites is slated for implementation in the testing of corpses in order to simplify the procedure and decrease tension with families and the community.

Operational readiness and preparedness: Starting in mid-September, the MoH, with support from WHO and partners, implemented a 30-day plan in six high-risk provinces neighbouring North Kivu. Implementation of that plan made substantial progress in establishing and strengthening multisectoral coordination, rapid response teams, surveillance and IPC, contact tracing, PoEs, risk communications and stockpiling of personal protective equipment (PPE). Building on this success and with a focus on sustained capacity development, the readiness plan has been extended for the next three months through the end of January 2019 within the Strategic Response Plan. Tshopo Province and Goma, North Kivu were added to this extension plan. All three levels of WHO are working closely with the governments of the nine neighbouring countries and partners to address major challenges of outbreak management, particularly at the PoE, and with focus on priority 1 countries (Uganda, South Sudan, Burundi and Rwanda). A substantial funding gap remains for the Regional Strategic Plan for EVD preparedness, posing challenges for full-scale implementing.

Partners

To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. Among the partners are a number of UN agencies and international organizations including: European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operation (ECHO); IOM; UK Public Health Rapid Support Team; United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF); UN High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR); World Bank and regional development banks; World Food Programme (WFP) and UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS); UN mission and UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS); Inter-Agency Standing Commission; United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA); Africa Centres for Disease Control; US CDC; UK Department for International Development (DFID); United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Adeco Federación (ADECO); Association des femmes pour la nutrition à assisse communautaire (AFNAC); Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA); CARITAS DRC; CARE International; Centre de promotion socio-sanitaire (CEPROSSAN); Cooperazione Internationale (COOPE); Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID/PAP-DRC); International Medical Corps; International Rescue Committee (IRC); Intersos – Organizzatione Umanitaria par l’Emergenza (INTERSOS); MEDAIR; Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF); Oxfam International; Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); Samaritan’s Purse; Save the Children (SCI); Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), Emerging and Dangerous Pathogens Laboratory Network (EDPLN), Emerging Disease Clinical Assessment and Response Network (EDCARN), technical networks and operational partners, and the Emergency Medical Team Initiative (EMT). GOARN partners continue to support the response through deployment for response and readiness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries and to different levels of WHO.

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country, which borders Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO’s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The IHR Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international travel to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

In its daily update today the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) health ministry reported four more lab-confirmed cases, three in the current outbreak epicenter in Beni and one in the city of Butembo.

Also, three more deaths were reported in confirmed patients, including two in Beni, one of which involved a death in the community rather than a healthcare center, an occurrence known to raise the risk of virus transmission to others. The third fatality involved a person from Butembo.

The new developments raise the outbreak total to 251 cases, 216 of them confirmed and 35 probable. The latest fatalities lift the death count to 162.

Meanwhile, about 1,000 students from universities and colleges in Beni peacefully marched through the city today to show support for the Ebola response. The ministry said students spent about 2 hours crisscrossing areas of the city where pockets of resistance have been reported to convince residents to collaborate with responders. The health ministry said the event marks the launch of the ""Ebola Pas Chez Moi"" (Ebola not at my house) campaign, designed to enlist the support of citizens in observing recommended steps for stopping the spread of the virus.

In vaccination developments, the ministry said that, because of large numbers of people being vaccinated, more immunization teams are being trained in Kinshasa and Butembo. Since immunization began in early August, 22,326 people have been vaccinated, nearly half of those in Beni.

FDA publishes new drafts of produce guidance

As part of the Food Safety and Modernization Act (FSMA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published its latest draft guidance documents on safe produce handling.

The first document, ""Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption: Guidance for Industry,"" is meant to help farms comply with the requirements of the Produce Safety Rule, which, according to the FDA, establishes minimum standards for the safe growing, harvesting, packing, and holding of produce. The guidance suggests schedules for cleaning and maintaining farm equipment, steps to keep pests out of buildings, requirements for hand-washing facilities in the produce supply chain, and many other measures.

The second guidance document is titled, ""Guide to Minimize Food Safety Hazards of Fresh-Cut Produce."" When finalized, the guidance will update and supersede the current guidance on the topic, which was written in 2008.

The FDA is seeking public comments on the draft guidance documents, and requests both electronic and written comments by Apr 22, 2019. The agency will also hold four public hearings in Oregon, California, New York, and Georgia in the coming months.

Dutch, Israeli study finds antibiotic overuse in children with viral infections

A team of Dutch and Israeli researchers report in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal that nearly a third of children hospitalized with a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by a virus were treated unnecessarily with antibiotics.

The patient population in the prospective study included children 1 month of age and over with an LRTI or fever without source from hospitals in the Netherlands and Israel. The researchers were looking to determine the incidence of bacterial coinfections and the amount of antibiotic overuse in children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common viral LRTI that is a risk factor for bacterial coinfection. In winter seasons, 20% of hospitalizations and 18% of emergency department visits for acute respiratory infections in young children are associated with RSV.

A total of 784 children were recruited from October 2013 through May 2016, and 188 children (24%) were positive for RSV. Of the 188 RSV-positive children, 92 (49%) were treated with antibiotics, including 27 (14%) who had bacterial coinfections and were treated appropriately and 8 in whom an expert panel could not distinguish simple viral infection from bacterial coinfection. That left 57 children (30%) treated unnecessarily with antibiotics. Antibiotic overuse was similar among Dutch and Israeli children.

""In conclusion, our data show that although bacterial coinfections in children with RSV infections are relatively rare, high percentages of antibiotic prescriptions are common,"" the authors of the study wrote. ""Further research is need to develop accurate and practical tools to help physicians recognizing bacterial coinfections in children infected with RSV.""

Nov 2018 Pediatr Infect Dis J abstract",no result found,no result found,no result found,"The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has reached a dangerous phase, with the response operation acknowledging it hasn’t got a full picture of where the virus is spreading in a large urban center.

That concerning development is tempered slightly by signs that people living in Beni, the current hot spot of transmission, are beginning to comprehend more fully the danger the virus poses, said a senior World Health Organization official.

That understanding is translating into better cooperation — a welcome development in an outbreak response that has had more than its share of bad luck.

“There is underground community transmission in Beni. It may not be at a very intense level. But it is enough to continue and drive transmission in this town. And we need to stop it,” said Dr. Mike Ryan, assistant director-general of the WHO’s emergency preparedness and response program. “We need to pull the roots of this thing out of this city.”

By underground transmission, Ryan means that there are cases that have no discernible connection to previous Ebola patients, cases that cannot be mapped onto any known chains of transmission.

As of Wednesday, there have been 88 cases reported in October — more than a third of all cases in the outbreak, which likely began in July. The total to date is 247 confirmed and probable cases and 159 deaths.

If the response teams don’t know where the virus is spreading, they can’t apply the containment measures that will stop that transmission. In a city the size of Beni — population: 200,000 — that’s a dangerous prospect.

“Beni is going to be a grind. There’s no other way to look at it,” said Ryan, who was in the northeastern Congo city when he spoke to STAT. “This is rooting out an entrenched virus in an urban environment, in a traumatized population where there is clear compromises to security.”

North Kivu, the province in which the outbreak is occurring, is under siege and has been for years. Heavily armed militia groups in the region launch regular attacks against the Congolese army. Just last weekend, there were back-to-back attacks against an army checkpoint and within the city itself. Civilians and army personnel were killed and a number of children were abducted.

An earlier attack in Beni in late September prompted civil society groups to declare days of mourning — so-called “ville morte,” which is French for “dead city” — as a form of civilian protest of the violence. The city shut down for five days, and the Ebola response teams were forced to substantially scale back on their work.

A week later, cases started to climb and that rebounding of transmission still hasn’t been brought under control.

After the latest round of violence, the Ebola response team received a much-needed break of a sort, with community leaders in Beni deciding against declaring a new ville morte period.

“Beni is going to be a grind. There’s no other way to look at it.” Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO

Ryan said officials from the Congolese ministry of health, the WHO, and other partners in the response discussed the issue Sunday with the civil society leaders, who realized how dangerous it would be to again scale back containment efforts. On Monday, the response operations were back at full steam.

“I think in some ways it represents a turning point in the community in general. I think they were extremely frustrated, very angry about the attack. But I think also in the last couple of weeks they’ve really recognized that Ebola is also a major threat and it’s affecting their community,” Ryan said.

He suggested there are other signs that the people of Beni are becoming more cooperative with the response teams. For instance, there’s increasing demand for the experimental vaccine being used to help contain the epidemic. So far, more than 21,500 people have been vaccinated, roughly 10,300 of them in Beni.

The vaccine is not being offered to everyone. Those on the front line — health care personnel and burial teams among them — have been vaccinated. But in the broader community, the strategy being deployed is called ring vaccination, which involves vaccinating the contacts of known cases and the contacts of those contacts. The idea is that if people who might otherwise develop the disease are protected, the virus won’t be able to spread.

In the past, contact tracing has been hampered by the fact that people didn’t want to be listed as contacts, and a portion evaded the daily checks from the response teams to see if they had developed symptoms. As word gets out about the vaccine, though, attitudes are changing, Ryan said.

“It’s gone from people not wanting to be associated with contact lists to demanding to be on the contact list. Faith in vaccination is growing,” he said.

A steadily increasing pool of survivors — 65 to date — is also serving as good publicity for the Ebola treatment units, where patients are cared for in isolation by health workers decked out in the necessary protective gear. Word is circulating as well that patients in the ETUs, as they are called, are being treated with experimental drugs. Both the drugs and the vaccine are serving as “pull factors” that enhance community cooperation, Ryan said.

Still, huge challenges remain. For instance, the response teams have been trying to figure out why so many young children are getting sick in this outbreak, including children under 5 years old. Young children normally make up a small portion of Ebola cases.

Ryan said there are probably a number of factors contributing to the phenomenon. Some of the youngest children may have been infected through breastfeeding, for instance. But a big driver is likely the heavy local reliance on practitioners of traditional medicine who work in what are known as “tradi-modern” clinics.

Conditions and the level of medical expertise in these clinics — which are generally the first port of call when someone gets sick — vary from place to place. Some of the practitioners have some medical training, others do not. And fundamentals of infection control, such as only using syringes once, aren’t universally applied, Ryan said.

Ebola response workers know of at least 202 of these tradi-modern centers. Describing one he had visited this week, Ryan said, “It was a room in a house. You would have passed by it a million times and never knew that it was a treatment center.”

The outbreak is happening during peak malaria season, and some of the children who became infected with Ebola were cared for in tradi-modern clinics. It’s clear transmission has happened in a number of these centers, Ryan said.

The response teams have been trying to enlist these clinics in the fight against Ebola, checking in with them daily to hear if any patients were showing signs of the disease. The strategy is starting to pay dividends, Ryan said, noting that there seems to have been a decline in pediatric cases in the past week.

Ryan is a veteran of many outbreak responses, for Ebola and other diseases. He calls himself “a pathological optimist” and said he believes the response teams will get the upper hand on the virus, though it’s going to take “weeks of very, very hard work.”

A break from the violence that keeps the city on edge would be welcome. “The greatest gift we could receive right now is … calm and peace,” said Ryan. “Because we’re fighting one war against the virus. And it doesn’t really work very well when you have to deal with another one.”"

Officials probe 47 suspected cases

The 6 new illnesses in Beni, part of a steady stream of cases from the region, bring the outbreak total to 257 cases, which includes 222 confirmed and 35 probable infections.

Two more deaths were reported, one from Beni and the other from Butembo, the city that continues to report cases and deaths. So far 164 people have died in the DRC's latest outbreak, which is affecting North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the northeast part of the country.

Another 47 suspected Ebola cases are under investigation.

The number of people reached with the ring vaccination campaign continues to increase, with 22,811 immunized so far, about half of them in Beni.

In another response development, the DRC's health ministry said the capacity of the Ebola treatment center in Mangina, the earlier outbreak hot spot, had been reduced by 16 beds, while the one in Beni has been increased to 60 beds to allow for the best quality of care given the high volume of suspected and confirmed cases in that health zone.

Vaccine data lacking for pregnant women

Ebola vaccine was among the topics that the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunizations discussed this week at its meeting in Geneva.

At a media telebriefing today, the group's chair Alejandro Cravioto, MD, with the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said the group examined data on using Ebola vaccine in pregnant women. The VSV-EBOV vaccine contains live virus, which typically isn't recommended for use in pregnant women. He said health officials are following a small number of women who didn't know they were pregnant when they received the VSV-EBOV vaccine and some who were inadvertently vaccinated.

Joachim Hombach, PhD, MPH, executive secretary of SAGE and senior advisor at the European Vaccine Initiative, said the risk-benefit analysis suggests that risk of contracting Ebola is very low for nonvaccinated people—including pregnant women—in settings where ring vaccination is under way.

In the months ahead, health officials hope to have more information from detailed follow-up on pregnant women who were vaccinated, officials said, adding that there's not enough evidence for SAGE for make a final conclusion. They added that local ethics committees may also be taking up the issue, based on the situation on the ground.

Advisors foresee role for second vaccine

During their meeting this week, SAGE members also heard status reports on several other Ebola vaccines that are in the development pipeline.

Cravioto said the only other vaccine that the group sees being used in the near future is the prime-boost regimen that combines a priming dose of the adenovirus-vectored Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson and a booster dose of MVA-BN-Filo from Bavarian Nordic. He said SAGE advisors heard a presentation on phase 2 findings for the vaccine.

Over the past few years, experts have said they see roles for different Ebola vaccine formulations. For example, VSV-EBOV has been useful in outbreak settings, because it induces rapid protection, but researchers are exploring vaccines that could provide long-lasting protection for preventive vaccination campaigns, including protecting health workers in outbreak zones.

The vaccines in the Johnson & Johnson regimen are genetically modified so they can't replicate, which might provide an option that health officials would be more comfortable recommending for pregnant women.

Cravioto said it's up the company to decide the next steps for the clinical trial, but the group suggested including pregnant women.

CDC director says he pushed to keep U.S. experts in Ebola zone but was overruled

WASHINGTON — The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that he argued that American experts should stay in the outbreak zone of the latest Ebola epidemic but was overridden by others in the Trump administration because of security concerns.

“Those decisions are security decisions that really are outside the realm of my public health expertise,” said the director, Robert Redfield, who said he made a case to the Department of Health and Human Services about why public health experts should remain in the outbreak area but that, at the end of the day, his argument didn’t win out.

The CDC was forced to withdraw workers from the outbreak zone in the Democratic Republic of Congo several weeks ago amid security concerns. It’s unclear whether officials at HHS, which oversees the CDC, pushed for the Ebola experts to remain. But sources told STAT earlier this month that the State Department recommended they be withdrawn.

“I do think they’re at an enormous disadvantage by not having the expertise the CDC has on the ground,” Redfield said.

The CDC director said he would like to see “a small footprint of CDC employees” back in the area. He added: “I’d be happy to be one of them.”

He made the comments during an interview with STAT Executive Editor Rick Berke at the opening session of the Milken Institute’s Future of Health Summit.

The outbreak in North Kivu province in the DRC has been worsening in recent weeks, with containment efforts hampered by ongoing violence. Response teams hoped that an experimental vaccine could help curb the epidemic but the security situation has made it difficult to track the course of the virus and to deliver the vaccine to those who need it.

As of Monday, there have been 238 confirmed and probable cases in this outbreak and 155 deaths.

The CDC has some of the most experienced Ebola epidemiologists in the world, and public health experts agree that their presence in the outbreak zone could help immensely. At the same time, they acknowledge that the security situation in North Kivu is perilous.

Eleven of the new cases were in Beni, the outbreak epicenter, and the remaining 6 were recorded in nearby Butembo. The new infections bring the total number of cases to 274, including 139 deaths. Thirty-two suspected cases are under investigation.

At least one of the deaths over the weekend was a community death in Butembo, DRC officials said. Community deaths pose a greater threat of virus spread than those that occur in a hospital or Ebola treatment center because of the likelihood of added exposure.

From Oct 22 to Oct 28, DRC officials confirmed 36 new cases (28 in Beni and 8 in Butembo) and 19 deaths.

Outbreak is DRC's 3rd largest

Though the outbreak is small compared with the 2014-2016 West African outbreak (which saw more than 28,000 cases), Congolese officials noted it has now surpassed the DRC's Luebo (Mweka) outbreak in 2007, when there were 265 recorded cases and 187 deaths.

The current outbreak, the country's 10th, is now the DRC's third largest, following the 1976 outbreak in Yambuku (318 cases) and 1995's outbreak in Kikwit (315 cases).

The outbreak is now the world's sixth largest since Ebola was first recorded in 1976.

Yesterday, 8,000 young people in Butembo and Beni were trained in Ebola response efforts, including a demonstration of a safe and dignified burial. Officials said the efforts were meant to ""increase the awareness actions for young people who are often at the root of resistance because of a lack of knowledge of the disease and its danger.""

As of today, vaccination totals have reached 24,142 people in the DRC, including 12,464 in Beni and 1,295 in Butembo.

Beni accounts for nearly half of all outbreak cases

The pair of newly confirmed cases reported from Beni lift the overall outbreak total to 276, which includes 241 confirmed and 35 probable infections, according to the health ministry's daily update.

Of the case total, nearly half (134) are from Beni, where responders have grappled not only with security problems due to conflict between rebel groups and armed forces, but also pockets of community resistance.

One new death was reported, which involved a patient from Beni. That development boosts the outbreak fatality total to 175 deaths.

The number of suspected cases has jumped to 65, up from 32 the previous day.

Responders continue to make headway with vaccination, and 24,510 people have now been immunized with VSV-EBOV, roughly half of them from Beni.

More health worker infections

In its weekly situation report today, the WHO said it has received 36 more illness reports since its last update on Oct 23. It said there are four new cases among health workers, one doctor and three nurses. All worked in health centers around Beni, raising the number of infected medical providers to 25, including 3 deaths.

The percentage of contacts successfully followed over the past week was 92% for all health zones and 91% for Beni. So far, 109 patients have received experimental treatments.

Though health officials are still concerned about security for burial teams, activities have resumed in Butembo for the first time since an Oct 2 security incident.

The number of confirmed cases in Beni and in and around Butembo continues to increase, and lingering security and community resistance challenges highlight the need to press ahead with community engagement activities, the WHO said.

The spurt in health worker infections is concerning and shows that infection prevention and control measures need to be stepped up in the affected areas, it added.

Lasting antibody response from 3 vaccines

On the research front, at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) annual meeting under way in New Orleans yesterday, researchers from the United Kingdom said the immune response from three Ebola vaccines, including VSV-EBOV, lasts at least 2.5 years.

The other two were prime-boost regimens that used one of two nonreplicating adenoviruses (ChAd3 and AdHu26) and the multivalent MVA BN-Filo, according to the meeting abstract. ChAd3 was developed by the National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline and AdHu26 was developed by Janssen and is part of Johnson and Johnson's candidate vaccine. MVA BN-Filo, developed by Bavarian Nordic, contains glycoproteins from Ebola Zaire and Sudan strains and Marburg virus.

The researchers based their findings on an analysis of blood samples from healthy volunteers who had taken part in earlier research studies involving three vaccines. So far, this is the longest researchers have been able to track Ebola vaccine response.

For their the prime-boost vaccines, the team looked at the durability of both humoral and cellular immunity. They found that 91% of 43 people who received the AdHu26 vaccine had positive glycoprotein-specific IgG titers 2.5 years after immunization, as did 54% of 13 who received the ChAd3 vaccine, according to the meeting abstract.

In a press release from ASTMH, Katie Ewer, PhD, with the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, said all three vaccines ""were still producing a strong antibody response to the disease two and a half years after immunization, which is really good news.""

She said another important question is if persistence can be enhanced by giving a late booster dose 3 to 4 years after initial immunization and that the group will study this in the United Kingdom and Senegal in the year ahead.

NIH institute pauses heart stem cell trial after calls for retractions A federal health agency has paused a clinical trial as doubts about the science underpinning the study continue to be raised. The CONCERT-HF trial was designed to test whether stem cells could repair damaged muscle in patients with chronic heart failure, based in part on a theory advanced by Dr. Piero Anversa. But earlier this month, Harvard and an affiliated hospital called for the retraction of 31 of the researcher's papers, including some in which they found he had ""committed research misconduct."" Anversa isn't working on the trial, but the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has halted it while a more thorough review is completed.



Separately, FDA investigators have determined that a Minneapolis hospital violated regulations on human research by testing powerful antipsychotics and ketamine on emergency room patients without their knowledge or consent. In response, a health watchdog group on Monday urged federal regulators to suspend all clinical trials at the hospital. Experimental Ebola vaccines offer lasting protection Researchers have found that three experimental Ebola vaccines — including the one being used to stem an ongoing outbreak — generate an immune response against the virus that lasts for at least two and a half years, a promising sign that the vaccines provide long-lasting protection. The researchers, who reported their findings at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, tested the vaccines on healthy volunteers and so far have found signs of persistent protection after two and a half years, up from the two years previously shown. One of the immunizations tested is a Merck vaccine, which health authorities are deploying as they respond to an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Inside STAT: Postpartum can be both boundless love and deep sadness. It shouldn’t mean silence “It was hard to admit that a mental health crisis had crept up on me, just weeks after one of the happiest days of my life. I told myself that I was exaggerating my own symptoms, that I was just overtired. Many women have it worse, I thought. I could make it work. And yet, even as I was ‘making it work,’ I was pierced by moments of breathtaking sadness.” That’s how Alissa Ambrose, STAT’s deputy director of multimedia and creative, describes her postpartum depression in a new First Opinion. Even with a strong support network, she struggled to admit something was wrong, and then to find appropriate help — both because of the stigma and the barriers to care.

The second study focused on gastroenterology practice guidelines, finding that the authors’ disclosures don’t always match their financial disclosures in a publicly available database. More here. Physicians group eyes gun-violence policies The American College of Physicians is out with its updated policy position on how to reduce gun violence, reiterating its support for a ban on civilian ownership of assault weapons. The group is also advocating for bolstered background checks and strengthened laws that prevent people convicted of domestic violence from owning guns. The latest iteration of the ACP's guidelines includes such previous recommendations as increased funding for gun-violence research and the need for doctors to talk with patients about the risks of keeping guns at home. It also adds the group's support to laws that allow family members to ask courts to remove a person's firearms in some situations.

The council passed the measure to ""ensure full, safe, immediate, and unhindered access for humanitarian and medical personnel, and their equipment, transport and supplies to the affected areas,"" according to a UN news release.

In adopting resolution 2439 (2018), the UN also officially condemned attacks by armed groups in the region. The resolution was sponsored by Ethiopia and Sweden, and the Security Council said negotiations on the text were influenced by two recent briefings to the council from the WHO director‑general.

The Security Council, made up of 15 UN members, also encouraged the DRC government and countries in the region to ""continue efforts to address and resolve the wider political, security, socioeconomic and humanitarian consequences of the Ebola outbreak, as well as to provide sustainable and responsive public health mechanisms,"" according to a the release.

Evaluating Ebola vaccine in the DRC

Also yesterday, during a session at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene's (ASTMH's) annual meeting, Merck's Jakub Simon, MD, MS, presented preliminary findings on the effectiveness of the ring vaccination strategies in DRC's two Ebola outbreaks this year.

In both outbreaks, Merck's unlicensed VSV-EBOV vaccine has been given to health workers, case contacts, and contacts of contacts.

Simon said that, in the first outbreak earlier this year in the western part of the DRC, the introduction of the ring vaccine campaign almost immediately lowered case counts, going from one to five cases per day to zero the day after the vaccine was introduced.

But in the current campaign, which reached 276 cases yesterday, case counts dropped over a 2-month period (though never reaching zero) and then spiked in recent weeks as violence and conflict in the region have limited workers' access to contacts. Throughout the entire outbreak, the vaccine has been deployed.

Though 13 phase 1 through 3 clinical trials have proven the vaccine to elicit a strong immune response and protect against disease, its unknown how useful the vaccine is at ending an outbreak in a conflict zone where workers can have limited access to contacts, Simon said, according to a story in Medpage Today.

1-Nov-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The increase over the past four weeks in confirmed case incidence (Figure 1), most notably in the city of Beni and communities around Butembo, is concerning. Security incidents continue to severely impact both civilians and frontline workers. Moreover, pockets of community resistance or reluctance continue to hamper timely detection of new cases and the effectiveness of response operations. Nevertheless, the response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak has seen significant improvements over the past weeks, including strong performances by field teams conducting case investigations, vaccinations, and community engagement and risk communication in priority areas.

Since the last Disease Outbreak News (i.e. during 24–30 October), 32 new confirmed EVD cases were reported: 24 from Beni, and seven from Butembo and one from Vuhovi. The seven new cases reported from Butembo reside in suburbs and villages within and surrounding the city. Of the newly reported cases, 14 were known contacts of previously confirmed cases at the time of reporting, one was linked retrospectively to a transmission chain, and 17 remain under investigation. Four health workers, from various health posts and hospitals around Beni, were among the newly infected; 25 health workers have been infected to date, of whom three have died.

As of 30 October 2018, 279 EVD cases (244 confirmed and 35 probable), including 179 deaths (144 confirmed and 35 probable)1, have been reported in eight health zones in North Kivu Province and three health zones in Ituri Province (Figure 2). Over the past week, 14 additional surivors were discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) and reintegrated into their communities; 81 patients have recovered to date.

With ongoing transmission in communities in North Kivu, the risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains very high. Over the course of the past week, alerts have been reported from the Tanganyika Province, Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, Uganda and Yemen. To date, EVD has been ruled out for all alerts from neighbouring provinces and countries.

Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 30 October 2018 (n=279)

*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning - trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.

Public health response

The Ministry of Health (MoH) continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

Surveillance : A review of surveillance activities highlighted a number of challenges in case and contact detection and investigation, as well as in data management. WHO is working closely with the MoH at the field level, with remote analytical support provided by Regional and headquarters teams to address these. At the field level, strategies and standard operation procedures (SOPs) are being revised and staff retrained, to optimise systems and processes, better integrate activities of contact tracing and vaccination teams, enhance active case searching, and improve data management. Investigations continue around the latest confirmed cases not originating from known transmission chains. As of 30 October, over 15 000 contacts have been registered, of which 5813 remain under surveillance 2 . Follow-up rates over the past week ranged from 85-92% across all health areas.

Vaccination : As of 31 October, 154 vaccination rings have been defined, in addition to 37 rings of health and frontline worker. To date, 25 298 eligible and consented people have been vaccinated, including 8916 health and frontline workers and 6578 children. Overall, vaccination teams have reached an additional 3345 eligible and consenting people in the past week.

Overall, vaccination teams have reached an additional 3345 eligible and consenting people in the past week. Clinical management and IPC : Activities are ongoing in both clinical management and IPC and are supported by several partners in the field. Almost all newly confirmed patients admitted to ETCs receive therapeutics. There remains ongoing challenges with delayed recognition of cases and referral to ETCs, which are often occurring only after a patient has visited a number of health facilities. Some patients die before reaching ETCs or shortly after arrival due to late presentation in illness course. In rare instances, therapeutics may need to be withheld due to a very poor prognosis. Breaches in various aspects of IPC practices remain an important reason for continuing transmission. Several activities are ongoing in the field to address these concerns.

Risk communication, community engagement, and social mobilization activities continue to focus on community ownership of the response and are integrated closely with other response pillars. The risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) teams are supporting community-based surveillance activities by reinforcing the reporting of alerts by community focal points and traditional healers. Safe and dignified burial and vaccination teams are also supported by RCCE in engaging families in dialogue to improve the acceptance of response interventions. Door-to-door house visits, community dialogue sessions, community sensitization activities and mass communication via local radio stations continue.

Door-to-door house visits, community dialogue sessions, community sensitization activities and mass communication via local radio stations continue. Safe and dignified burial (SDB) Capacity is provided both by Red Cross (RC) and Civil Protection (CP) teams. RC teams are operational in Mangina, Beni, Butembo, Tchomia and Bunia. CP teams are operational in Beni and Oicha. In addition, RC has trained teams in Goma and Mambasa that can be activated as needed. As of 30 October, a total of 384 SDB alerts were received, of which 328 (85%) were responded to successfully. Due to access restrictions to certain areas, briefing sessions are planned to sensitize all RC volunteers in North Kivu and Ituri about EVD. Similar sessions will be hled by the International Committee of the Red Cross for the Police services and Armed Forces. In addition, a harm reduction approach to community burials in hard-to-reach communities (whether because of security or geographical constraints) is planned so that access to information and materials to perform burials in a safer manner is available if SDB teams cannot access the burial location.

Laboratory capacity: Diagnostic testing capability has continued to expand as cases spread to new geographic areas. Five field Ebola laboratories providing near-patient testing have been established in Beni, Mutembo, Goma, Mangina and Tchomia; these are in addition to the national laboratory in Kinshasa. Testing volumes have increased in the past week; 438 samples tested in the week ending 28 October which is 30% more than the previous week.

Partners

To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. Among the partners are a number of UN agencies and international organizations including: European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operation (ECHO); International Organization for Migration (IOM); UK Public Health Rapid Support Team; United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF); UN High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR); World Bank and regional development banks; World Food Programme (WFP) and UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS); UN mission and UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS); Inter-Agency Standing Commission; United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA); Africa Centres for Disease Control; US CDC; UK Department for International Development (DFID); United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Adeco Federación (ADECO); Association des femmes pour la nutrition à assisse communautaire (AFNAC); Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA); CARITAS DRC; CARE International; Centre de promotion socio-sanitaire (CEPROSSAN); Cooperazione Internationale (COOPE); Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID/PAP-DRC); International Medical Corps; International Rescue Committee (IRC); Intersos – Organizzatione Umanitaria par l’Emergenza (INTERSOS); MEDAIR; Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF); Oxfam International; Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); Samaritan’s Purse; Save the Children (SCI); Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), Emerging and Dangerous Pathogens Laboratory Network (EDPLN), Emerging Disease Clinical Assessment and Response Network (EDCARN), technical networks and operational partners, and the Emergency Medical Team Initiative (EMT). GOARN partners continue to support the response through deployment for response and readiness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries and to different levels of WHO.

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country, which border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO’s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The IHR Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Vaccination: WHO convened a meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization from 23-25 October. The group noted that the risk of adverse effects from administering the live virus vaccine, rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP, to pregnant women remains largely unknown given the limited amount of data. SAGE recognized that the decision on whether to offer the vacicine to pregnant women is a complex matter and that inclusion of pregnant women in a research protocol depends on the local National Regulatory Authority and local Ethics Review Committee and, more importantly, on informed consent of the pregnant woman. SAGE therefore encourages researchers to seek opportunities to gather more data on the benefits and risks of administering this vaccine to pregnant women, particularly under conditions permitting close and sufficiently long follow-up of vaccinees to completely document outcomes. Such evidence may be available in the near future. The experts also encouraged research efforts to assess whether the vaccination of other contacts provides an effective ring of protection around pregnant women who do not receive the vaccine.

Also, the World Health Organization (WHO) again said the increase in Beni and Butembo is concerning, as security incidents threaten residents and frontline workers and pockets of resistance pose tough challenges.

First case in Vuhovi health zone

In its daily update yesterday, the DRC's health ministry said one of three new cases is from Vuhovi health zone, an area between Beni and Butembo. The patient is the husband of a confirmed patient who died in a Butembo Ebola treatment center on Oct 26.

The man refused follow-up and transfer to an Ebola treatment center and died at a Vuhovi health center. where samples were obtained.

Patients with Ebola who are treated in community health centers rather than Ebola treatment centers pose a higher risk of virus spread, given that isolation and infection prevention and control practices aren't as common.

Besides the man who died in Vuhovi, three other deaths were reported yesterday, two from Beni and one from Butembo, and one new death was reported today, that of a patient from Beni.

In today's update, the ministry reported six more cases, four in Beni and two in Butembo.

The new developments lift the overall outbreak total to 285 cases, including 250 confirmed and 35 probable. The fatality count is now at 180.

Also, health officials today said they are investigating 41 suspected Ebola cases.

New surveillance strategy

In other outbreak developments, the health ministry said recent investigation have shown that many of Beni's traditional medicine centers aren't referring patients with suspected Ebola infections to Ebola treatment centers in a timely manner.

To address the gap, officials are implementing a new surveillance strategy covering the city's 254 public and private health centers to see if hospitalized patients have symptoms that resemble Ebola.

""This active search strategy of cases explains the significant increase of the isolated suspect cases and taken in recent days in Beni. On average, surveillance teams visit 140 health facilities a day,"" the health ministry said.

Also, the health ministry today announced free healthcare in all parts of Butembo health zone as a way to encourage residents to quickly seek care. Free healthcare is already available in Beni, Mabalako, and Oicha health zones.

Amid concerns, significant response improvements

In an update today, the WHO said that, despite the spike in cases in Beni and Butembo over the past 4 weeks, it has seen some significant improvements, including strong performances by field teams conducting investigations, vaccinations, and community engagement and risk communication in target areas.

The agency said that, of 32 cases confirmed since its last update on Oct 25, 24 were in Beni, 7 were in Butembo, and 1 was in Vuhovi. The WHO added that the cases from Butembo are from suburbs and villages within and around the city.

Of the new cases, 14 were in known contacts and one was retrospectively linked to a known transmission chain. Responders are still investigating how 17 were infected.

Health workers to be vaccinated in Uganda

In neighboring Uganda, a vaccination campaign will begin on Nov 5 to vaccinate frontline health workers, health officials announced today.

Ainebyoona Emmanuel, public relations officer with Uganda's health ministry, said on Twitter today that the vaccine campaign will focus on high-risk districts and that the country has 2,100 doses on hand to vaccinate health workers.

Reassessing the response

Two global health experts from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), based in Washington, DC, said the outbreak response got off to a promising start but complex security issues and a lack of trust threaten to expand the outbreak to the regional and perhaps even global level.

The experts are J. Stephen Morrison, PhD, senior vice president and director of CSIS' Global Health Policy Center and Judd Devermont, who direct the group's Africa program.

In a report posted in the CSIS web site, the two said 90 days into the outbreak, there's a need to reassess the approach. They said mobilization by the DRC and international groups has been quick and laudable, and financial support hasn't been a serious constraint. Other positives include the availability of a vaccine and the use of experimental treatments.

Debilitating setbacks, attacks, mistrust

However, the attacks, mainly by Allied Democratic Forces against the DRC military, have had a ""concussive impact"" on the response. Morrison and Devermont say there have also been local attacks by eastern Congo's armed, community-based Mai-Mai militias. ""As long as ADF and other attacks continue, the response effort will remain vulnerable to debilitating setbacks,"" they wrote.

The DRC's federal government hasn't gained effective control or legitimacy in the east of the country where the outbreak is occurring, and presidential, regional, and legislative elections slated for Dec 23 could worsen tensions and raise the odds of bringing the outbreak under control, according to the report.

Government repression and lack of an effective international effort to protect citizens from violent groups have made residents of the outbreak areas suspicious, with some viewing the United Nations security forces as complicit in the massacres and nongovernmental organizations just there to make money, they said.

The two also voiced concerns about recent US policy, which has seen personnel shifts that have downgraded global health security at the White House and kept seasoned US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) expertise mainly on the sidelines due to security concerns.

Over the last 2 months, debate within the US government hasn't settled on a policy approach, which would include setting security preconditions for redeploying US personnel to the area around Beni, Morrison and Devermont wrote.

Senior US officials have signaled that stemming the outbreak could take a year or longer and that fears of an expanding outbreak are growing among experts, they said.

New questions, possible ways forward

The developments pose new questions, such as whether a different level of security thinking is needed given the active war-zone setting and if the worrying developments matter to the major world powers, given the rise of open skepticism of multilateralism.

According to the authors, plans are reportedly in the works for a high-level mission that might focus talks on the role of United Nations peacekeepers and others.

One option, they said, might be to protect the area against major attacks with the Force Intervention Brigade, part of the UN peacekeeping unit that has had success in the past neutralizing armed groups in the area.

They also suggested expanding deployment and support for DRC public health experts, many of whom were trained by the CDC. Also, they note that a few US steps could help buoy the international response, such as affirming the country's commitment to ending the outbreak, defining how many experts are needed in the outbreak epicenter, and assessing how to keep a small US contingent secure, which could include embedding US security personnel with UN peacekeeping forces.

""Progress along all of these far-flung fronts will be difficult, but practical solutions still lie within reach,"" Morrison and Devermont wrote.

The East African country has suffered regular outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg over the years, both high-fatality viral haemorrhagic fevers.

Parts of Uganda’s western border are about 100 km (62 miles)from sites of an Ebola outbreak taking place in Congo.

Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng said authorities would administer about 2,100 vaccinations covering so called frontline health personnel working in districts near the border.

Tens of thousands cross the border in both directions weekly for trade and family visits and other purposes, Aceng said.

Because of this the “risk of cross border transmission was assessed to be very high ... hence the need to protect our health workers with this vaccine,” she told a news conference.

Congo declared an outbreak of Ebola on Aug. 1 and there have been at least 139 deaths

Because of the short distance from the outbreaks in Congo, Uganda has been on high alert, with heightened screenings of arriving travelers and training of health personnel in border areas.

Aceng said widespread insecurity in eastern Congo’s North Kivu and Ituri provinces added to Uganda’s vulnerability to cross border transmission.

“The security situation in North Kivu and Ituri is hindering effective implementation of response activities,” Aceng said.

All but one of the cases are from Butembo and Beni, the current virus hotspots. Two of the new cases, a young mother and her 2-week old child, were diagnosed in Beni and later transferred to an Ebola treatment center in Mabalako at the family's request. Another patient is from Kalunguta.

The totals for the outbreak now stand at 300 cases (265 confirmed, 35 probable), including 186 deaths. In addition, 41 suspected cases are still under investigation.

The outbreak, the country's tenth, is its third largest. It began in Mabalako at the beginning of August, just weeks after the DRC declared an end to another Ebola outbreak on the Western side of the country. That outbreak was brought to a swift end once Merck's experimental vaccine was put to use in a ring vaccination program that targeted case contacts and contacts of contacts.

The current outbreak has been marked by fits of virus activity and violence in the outbreak region, which has hampered response and vaccination efforts.

WHO, UN leaders to visit

Today leaders from the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN) arrived in DRC to check in with outbreak response efforts.

Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's director-general of emergency preparedness and response, said on Twitter that he would be arriving in DRC today with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, and Jean-Pierre Lacroix, the under-secretary-general for the UN Peacekeeping forces.

""Looking forward to seeing our teams again and hearing what other support they need for the #Ebola response. So proud of their relentless hard work under the toughest conditions,"" Salama tweeted.

Last week, the United Nations ordered all armed rebel forces in the DRC to allow health workers and officials access in the outbreak zone, which has been the site of violent skirmishes among dozens of political groups, many of whom oppose outbreak response efforts.

Uganda OKs vaccine in health workers

Ainebyoona Emmanuel, the senior public realigns officer for the Ugandan Ministry of Health said on Twitter Uganda has officially approved the use of the vaccine for healthcare workers, a move hinted at last week.

He said health workers who will be doing the immunizing are undergoing retraining today and tomorrow and the first injections will be administered on Nov 7.

Though there has so far been no spillover of cases in Uganda, there have been several scares, and the nation is preparing for the worst. North Kivu and Ituri provinces border Uganda, and more than 1 million refugees live in the communities that straddle the border.

In the DRC as of today, a total of 26,463 people in the DRC have been vaccinated against the virus, including 14,033 in Beni, 4,436 in Mabalako, 2,152 in Katwa, 1,663 in Mandima, and 1,435 in Butembo.

Meanwhile, high-level talks are under way between global health officials in the DRC to see what more can be done to shore up the security situation in the outbreak zone and what other resources the country needs to battle the virus.

More illnesses, deaths probed in Kalunguta

The DRC's health ministry said several Ebola infections have been identified in a Mayi-Mayi village in Kalunguta health zone, located in a red zone, following the escape of a patient from Beni who fled to the village to evade response teams.

On Sep 23 the health ministry had said that a patient from Beni had escaped from a treatment center in Beni and was found in an unsecured part of Kalunguta health zone, but it's unclear if that patient is the one linked to the spurt of new cases from the area. Overall, 6 cases have been reported in Kalunguta health zone, including one reported yesterday.

Since the outbreak began in the conflict-ridden part of the DRC, health officials have continually warned of the risk of the disease circulating undetected in insecure areas where it's difficult and dangerous for responders to identify cases, trace contacts, and get people vaccinated.

Outbreak responders negotiated with village leaders to organize an investigation mission to examine people who are sick and probe deaths that have occurred in the previous weeks, the health ministry said. ""So far, villagers have been cooperative, and vaccination has begun."" According to today's update, 507 people in Kalunguta have been vaccinated.

One of the new cases in Kalunguta involves a 6-day-old baby boy of an infected mother who died on Nov 4 at an Ebola treatment center in Butembo. The mother's symptoms began 5 days before her son was born.

The other new cases reported today are in Beni and Butembo. Three new deaths reported involve people from Beni, Butembo, and Mabalako. The new developments push the outbreak total to 305, which includes 270 confirmed and 35 probable cases. The death total has now reached 189.

Health officials are still investigating 60 suspected Ebola infections in the region.

WHO, UN officials visit Goma today

A delegation from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN) are in the DRC this week to assess the country's needs in battling the outbreak and securing the affected areas. The group includes WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's director-general for emergency preparedness, and Jean-Pierre Lacroix, the under-secretary-general for the UN peacekeeping forces.

According to the WHO, the group is expected to visit Beni tomorrow and will be in the DRC until Thursday.

On Twitter today, Lacroix said the group met with North Kivu province's governor in Goma today. He also tweeted, ""The health workers in the Ebola affected zone do crucial work amidst a difficult security environment. They need our full support."" Lacroix added that MONUSCO, the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC, is actively supporting the DRC's government to improve security. He added that the health and safety of North Kivu's civilians is the group's greatest priority.

CDC director warns Ebola could become endemic

At a Capitol Hill briefing yesterday, Robert Redfield, MD, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the situation in the DRC's latest outbreak is so serious that international health officials need to consider the possibility that it can't be contained and that the disease would become endemic in the area, the Washington Post reported. The briefing was held by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

Experts at the briefing said that if Ebola transmission in the DRC shifts to an endemic pattern, the spread of the virus would be sustained, be unpredictable, and have major implications for trade and travel. They noted that the population of North Kivu province, where most of the cases have been reported, is larger than the whole population of Liberia, one of the three countries affected in West Africa's outbreak.

They also said an uncontrolled, endemic situation could drive a shift in vaccination strategy in which health officials would consider vaccinating broader population rather than the current ring vaccination plan that focuses on contacts and contacts of contacts, according to the Post report.

In August, because of the shaky security situation in Beni, the outbreak's main hot spot, the CDC pulled some of its experts.

Community deaths, which occur outside of a hospital or Ebola treatment center, threaten to extend the transmission chain of a given case and further accelerate the mounting case count.

The WHO also said that two of the recent cases in Beni were in nurses, bringing the total of healthcare workers infected during this outbreak to 27, including 26 confirmed and 3 deaths. And vaccination efforts have expanded to front-line healthcare workers in neighboring Uganda, the agency noted.

Also today. the WHO said on its Ebola outbreak dashboard there were 3 new cases of Ebola, bringing the outbreak total to 308, including 191 deaths.

As of Nov 4, the case-fatality ratio (CFR) of the outbreak was 62% (186/300). But with more than 30 cases reported in the week of Oct 30 and this week, that percentage could be higher. The outbreak has affected women in greater numbers, with 59% of cases occurring in females, the WHO said. The majority (59%) of cases have also been in teens and younger adults, ages 15 to 44.

A total of 88 patients (as of Nov 4) have recovered, and 91 remain hospitalized at Ebola treatment centers.

About half of all cases in this outbreak have originated in Beni, which has been the site of violence from rebel armed forces who have opposed outbreak response efforts.

""The provinces have been experiencing intense insecurity and a worsening humanitarian crisis, with over one million internally displaced people and continuous movement of refugees to neighbouring countries, including Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania,"" the WHO said.

Vaccination, surveillance efforts still under way

Health officials have tracked more than 16,000 case contacts during this outbreak, of which more than 4,000 are still being traced. On average, health workers on the ground are getting 161 alerts of potential cases each day; about 52 cases per day are validated as suspected cases.

""Over the past week, high contact follow-up rates were achieved (ranging 90-92% per day),"" the WHO said. However, a large proportion of newly identified cases continue to be detected among individuals who were not previously identified as contacts.""

The surveillance activities go hand in hand with the ongoing implementation of a ring vaccination campaign in the DRC. As of Nov 4, officials have identified168 rings, and approximately 27,000 people in the DRC have been vaccinated against the virus, including at least 9,105 healthcare workers and 7,006 children.

Today health officials in Uganda announced that the first wave of health officials have been vaccinated in Ntoroko district, which borders the DRC, according to a WHO news release. Workers in five other high-risk districts bordering the DRC will also be vaccinated.

So far, no Ugandans have contracted the virus during this outbreak.

8-Nov-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

As the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak enters the fourth month since declaration, and case numbers surpass 300, substantial progress has been achieved in all aspects of the response. Nevertheless, there remains a challenging road ahead to control intense transmission in the city of Beni and emerging hotspots in villages around Beni and Butembo. Security incidents and pockets of community resistance continue to impact civilians and frontline workers, requiring the response to continually adapt to the situation. The UN is committed to staying and supporting the Ministry of Health (MoH), and confident that the outbreak can be contained. This week, the WHO Director-General, UN Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping, and WHO Deputy Director-General (DDG) Emergency Preparedness and Response travelled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to review how further support can be offered to strengthen the response.

Over the past week (31 October – 6 November), 29 new confirmed EVD cases were reported: 15 from Beni, seven from Butembo, four from Kalunguta, two from Mabalako, and one from Vuhovi. The two cases reported in Mabalako were a mother and her new-born child, residing and infected in Beni, but sought treatment at the Mabalako Ebola treatment centre (ETC). Three health workers from health posts in Beni and Kalunguta were among the newly infected; 28 health workers have been infected to date. Ten additional survivors were discharged from the Beni ETC and reintegrated into their communities; 88 patients have recovered to date.

As of 6 November, 308 EVD cases (273 confirmed and 35 probable), including 189 deaths (154 confirmed and 35 probable)1, have been reported in eight health zones in North Kivu Province and three health zones in Ituri Province (Figure 1). While fewer cases were reported from Beni this week, new cases continue to be detected daily here and elsewhere, and delays in case detection persist; therefore, trends in weekly incidence must be interpreted cautiously (Figure 2).

The risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains very high. Over the course of the past week, alerts have been reported from the South Sudan, Uganda and Yemen; EVD has been ruled out for all alerts to date. Uganda (geographically closest to outbreak affected areas), continues to intensify preparedness activities, and this week began to vaccinate health and frontline workers at priority health facilities.

Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 6 November 2018 (n=303)*

*Onset date unknown for five cases. Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning – trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

Surveillance : Demonstrated impacts are being observed following renewed efforts and improved systems by field teams to overcome challenges in case and contact detection, investigation, and data analytics. Though a large proportion of new cases reported in Beni during the past week and earlier were not listed as contact at the time of reporting, investigators have retrospectively elucidated the transmission chains for the majority of cases. Meanwhile, contact tracing continues with almost 18 000 contacts registered since the start of the outbreak, of which 5430 remain under surveillance as of 6 November. 2 Follow-up rates over the past week ranged from 91-94% in total across all health areas.

Vaccination : As of 31 October, 174 vaccination rings have been defined, in addition to 38 rings of health and frontline worker. To date, 27 360 eligible and consented people have been vaccinated, including 9106 health and frontline workers and 7256 children.

To date, 27 360 eligible and consented people have been vaccinated, including 9106 health and frontline workers and 7256 children. Clinical management and IPC : Activities are ongoing in both clinical management and IPC and are supported by several partners in the field. Almost all newly confirmed patients admitted to ETCs receive therapeutics. There remain ongoing challenges with delayed recognition of cases and referral to ETCs, which are often occurring only after a patient has visited a number of health facilities. Some patients die before reaching ETCs or shortly after arrival due to late presentation in illness course. In rare instances, therapeutics may need to be withheld due to a very poor prognosis. Several IPC activities such as decontamination of health care facilities and households, and IPC trainings are ongoing. Breaches in various aspects of IPC practices remain an important reason for continuing transmission. Several activities are ongoing in the field to address these concerns.

Feedback to concerns raised by the community through door-to-door visits, focused group discussions and knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) surveys are being systematically collected and addressed. This week, advocacy meetings are held with local pharmacies in Butembo, with traditional healer in Butsili and follow-up discussions on Ebola sensitization are held with community leaders and women’s groups in Beni. Community dialogue sessions were also held in Katwa.

Harm Reduction approach to manage burials in areas non-accessible by SDB teams, as well as implementation of Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for deceased, are being reviewed. There is a continuous need to sensitise communities, opinion leaders and authorities (e.g. police and military) on SDB to mitigate resistance.

Preparedness and operational readiness: Ministry of Health deployed 56 preparedness officers (43 national government experts and 13 WHO consultants) this week to ten high risk provinces around North Kivu to scale up operational readiness capacities and rapid response teams for IPC, risk communications, surveillance, points of entry screening, and coordination. Operational readiness actions continue to be strengthened in the nine neighbouring countries, with enhanced efforts in Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda and Burundi. The implementation of the contingency plans for EVD readiness are underway in collaboration with partners. Twelve experts were deployed in South Sudan to enhance the efforts of readiness in Nimule, Yei and Yambio.

Partners

To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. Among the partners are a number of UN agencies and international organizations including: European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operation (ECHO); International Organization for Migration (IOM); UK Public Health Rapid Support Team; United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF); UN High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR); World Bank and regional development banks; World Food Programme (WFP) and UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS); UN mission and UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS); Inter-Agency Standing Commission; United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA); Africa Centres for Disease Control; US CDC; UK Department for International Development (DFID); United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Adeco Federación (ADECO); Association des femmes pour la nutrition à assisse communautaire (AFNAC); Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA); CARITAS DRC; CARE International; Centre de promotion socio-sanitaire (CEPROSSAN); Cooperazione Internationale (COOPE); Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID/PAP-DRC); International Medical Corps; International Rescue Committee (IRC); Intersos – Organizzatione Umanitaria par l’Emergenza (INTERSOS); MEDAIR; Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF); Oxfam International; Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); Samaritan’s Purse; Save the Children (SCI); Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), Emerging and Dangerous Pathogens Laboratory Network (EDPLN), Emerging Disease Clinical Assessment and Response Network (EDCARN), technical networks and operational partners, and the Emergency Medical Team Initiative (EMT). GOARN partners continue to support the response through deployment for response and readiness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries and to different levels of WHO.

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country, which border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO’s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The IHR Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Abducted responders found safe

Underscoring ongoing deep concerns about security problems in the area, the DRC's health ministry said Mai Mai rebels in a village between Beni and Butembo—the outbreak's hot spots— abducted four members of the Ebola response. The responders were later found by police to be safe, according to the health ministry's daily update yesterday.

Following a call to emergency services by the family of a person who died in the community, the responders, who included three civil protection agents and an epidemiologist, were at the home of a recently deceased patient to decontaminate the house and remove the body to prepare it for burial. After rebels abducted the responders, security coordinators sent an alert to police, who found the group safe and sound.

Top officials get firsthand look at Beni

Security problems related to armed rebel groups and pockets of community resistance have led to several setbacks in the response to the outbreak, which is just 7 cases from becoming the DRC's largest Ebola outbreak ever. Given tough challenges containing the outbreak, health officials are in the DRC this week to hear from local officials and groups and see what more can be done.

Yesterday in Beni, the DRC's Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD; North Kivu province's governor; UN Undersecretary General for Peacekeeping Jean-Pierre Lacroix; and WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, were among a group who visited the emergency operations center and met with local security officials at the local town hall.

In a statement from the WHO and UN today, the groups said new measures to overcome response challenges are having a positive impact, with a decline in the rate of new cases over the past 2 weeks, though the outbreak is still dangerous and unpredictable.

MONUSCO, the UN's peacekeeping mission in the DRC, has recently taken an active approach toward armed groups operating in North Kivu, which has resulted in a recent calm period in and around Beni, though some attacks continue in surrounding villages. Since the start of the outbreak, MONUSCO has provided logistical support, office facilities, transportation, communication, and security.

Decades of conflict in North Kivu have led to misinformation and mistrust that had contributed to reluctance among some residents to allow Ebola teams to vaccinate, trace contacts, and perform safe burials.

Heightened community surveillance

The groups said that, under the leadership of the DRC's health ministry, the WHO and its partners have made greater use of community surveillance, in which community members are trained to do contact tracing in areas that are difficult for outsiders to access.

According to the statement, WHO and UN officials also met with DRC Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala to share their observations and recommendations.

As the team wrapped up its visit today, Lacroix on Twitter today praised the work of colleagues in the DRC and partner groups. But he also said that making the outbreak area safer requires a team effort. ""The message delivered today is that improving security in North Kivu is everyone's responsibility: MONUSCO and the DRC armed forces. Communities must also be engaged,"" he said.

Lacroix said partnerships and sustained long-term efforts will defeat the armed groups.

Four new cases, newly affected health zone

The DRC today reported 4 new cases, raising the outbreak total to 312, with the number of deaths remaining at 191. One of the new cases is in Beni, two are in Kalunguta health zone, which is in an insecure area, and 1 is in Mutwanga health zone, the first in that area.

The DRC said Mutwanga health zone is near Beni and the patient who is sick with Ebola there is a known contact of a person from Beni who fled to Mutwanga after refusing vaccination and not completing follow-up monitoring. The man, considered a high-risk contact, has agreed to be transferred to an Ebola treatment center in Beni.

As of today, 40 suspected cases are still under investigation, the DRC health ministry said.

Yesterday, the DRC health ministry in its daily update fleshed out information about 3 new cases reported by the WHO yesterday: 2 were in Beni and 1 in Vuhovi, a recently affected health zone located between Beni and Butembo.

“We are absolutely concerned about the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo,” the senior USAID official, who is working with response teams, told Reuters. “It is not comparable at this point to the outbreak that occurred in West Africa in 2014,” which spread to nine countries and involved more than 28,000 cases, she said.

But there is worry that the current outbreak was in an active conflict zone in North Kivu, making it hard for health workers to track down and isolate cases, the official said.

“It is occurring in an area of active conflict, so physical insecurity is a persistent challenge and complication to the ongoing response efforts,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

“At this point we are not seeing cases spread across any incredibly large geographic area,” the official said, adding that most cases were in the city of Beni and increasingly in nearby Butembo.

The rate of new cases has accelerated in recent weeks, and neighboring Uganda has said it will begin to vaccinate some of its health workers against Ebola in case the viral hemorrhagic fever spread from Congo.

The World Health Organization’s committee has said that the outbreak did not yet constitute a public health emergency of international concern.

The USAID official said the United States had deployed over two dozen technical experts to the country to work with Congo’s health ministry since the outbreak was first reported in August.

Since then, the United States had also deployed disaster and health experts from USAID and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The official declined to give specifics about responses and funding because of the security threat from armed groups.

Congo has suffered 10 Ebola outbreaks since the virus was discovered near its eponymous Ebola River in 1976.

The official said lessons learned from the West Africa Ebola crisis were currently being applied in Congo, including improved approaches to treatment and isolation that allow for better patient care.","Sponsored by How will the Democrats approach health care?

WHO releases a first-of-its-kind guideline The WHO just released its first-ever set of guidelines on how to meet the physical health needs of people living with serious mental illnesses. People with severe mental disorders — which include moderate to severe depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and other conditions — are at a higher risk of certain other health conditions. They also often lack access to high-quality care. The WHO is trying to close some of those gaps with the new guidelines, which lay out how clinicians should approach everything from tobacco cessation to heart disease in people with serious mental illnesses. Surgery patients prescribed far more opioids than they take New research adds to that evidence that opioids are often overprescribed after surgery. Researchers looked at data from nearly 2,400 patients who had surgery in Michigan in 2017.

""On Friday, November 9, 2018, the Ebola Virus Disease epidemic in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri just exceeded that of the first epidemic recorded in 1976 in Yambuku, the province of Ecuador,"" said Minister of Health Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, in a DRC health ministry update.

""No other epidemic in the world has been as complex as the one we are currently experiencing,"" Kalenga added. ""Since their arrival in the region, the response teams have faced threats, physical assaults, repeated destruction of their equipment, and kidnapping. Two of our colleagues in the Rapid Response Medical Unit even lost their lives in an attack.""

Even with the extensive use of Merck's Ebola vaccine, the virus has held the region captive as response efforts have been slowed by violent skirmishes and community resistance over the last 3 months.

Seven new deaths, 52 suspected cases

In total, 198 people have died during this outbreak, which is 7 more than the DRC reported yesterday. And 52 suspected cases are still under investigation, up from 40 yesterday, according to the WHO data.

In a disease outbreak update published yesterday, the WHO said substantial progress has been made to control the outbreak, while acknowledging that ""there remains a challenging road ahead to control intense transmission in the city of Beni and emerging hotspots in villages around Beni and Butembo.""

From Oct 31 to Nov 6, officials have recorded 29 new case, including 15 in Beni, 7 in Butembo, 4 in Kalunguta, 2 in Mabalako, and 1 in Vuhov. Today, one of the new cases was recorded in Kyondo Health Zone, located next to Butembo.

Though no cases have crossed DRC's borders, the WHO said the risk for international spread remains high.

""The risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains very high. Over the course of the past week, alerts have been reported from the South Sudan, Uganda and Yemen; EVD [Ebola virus disease] has been ruled out for all alerts to date,"" the WHO said.

FDA approves Ebola fingerstick test

In related developments, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today announced an emergency use authorization (EUA) for a new rapid results fingerstick Ebola test. The single-use test uses a portable battery-operated reader, which makes it useful for testing outside of laboratories and in remote areas, the agency said in a news release.

The test, called the DPP Ebola Antigen System, is the second rapid fingerstick Ebola test to hit the market.

""This EUA is part of the agency's ongoing efforts to help mitigate potential, future threats by making medical products that have the potential to prevent, diagnosis or treat available as quickly as possible,"" said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, MD in a press release.

""We're committed to helping the people of the DRC effectively confront and end the current Ebola outbreak. By authorizing the first fingerstick test with a portable reader, we hope to better arm health care providers in the field to more quickly detect the virus in patients and improve patient outcomes.""

The FDA did not specify the accuracy of the test nor provide the data that led to the EUA.

Declining US support

In other US response news, Jeremy Youde, PhD, an associate professor of international relations at the Australian National University, wrote in the Washington Post how exactly the US federal government pulled out on-the-ground support in the DRC in mid-October. Youde quotes an analyst who calls the move part of the ""post-Benghazi hangover of the US government's risk aversion.""

Despite arguments from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield, MD, to the contrary, the federal government said that keeping American workers on the ground was too dangerous. Other countries, however, including Canada and Great Britain, have personnel in the region, as does the Gates Foundation.

Youde said that, while US involvement wouldn't suddenly end the outbreak, pulling out support sets a dangerous precedent for America.

The announcement late on Friday came amid increasing warnings that the situation could deteriorate because of attacks by armed groups and community resistance in the affected areas in eastern DRC.

Oly Ilunga Kalenga, the DRC's health minister, said a total of 319 confirmed and probable cases have been reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces since the outbreak was declared in August.

The figure exceeds the 318 cases documented in 1976, when the deadly Ebola virus was first identified in Yambuku, in the Equateur province.

{articleGUID}

Kalenga said 198 deaths have been recorded so far in the current outbreak, the country's 10th, including 165 confirmed cases, with 35 probable deaths. Of the 284 confirmed cases, 97 have survived.

""This epidemic remains dangerous and unpredictable, and we must not let our guard down,"" Kalenga said in a statement.

""We must continue to pursue a very dynamic response that requires permanent readjustments and real ownership at the community level.""

'World's most complex epidemic'

But the medical response has been complicated by regular attacks by armed groups battling for control in the mineral-rich eastern parts of the country.

Health officials have also reported cases of community resistance.

""No other epidemic in the world has been as complex as the one we are currently experiencing,"" said Kalenga.

According to the minister, the teams responding to the outbreak are attacked on average three or four times a week, in an unprecedented level of violence compared with the country's nine previous outbreaks.

""Since their arrival in the region, the response teams have faced threats, physical assaults, repeated destruction of their equipment and kidnapping,"" said Kalenga.

""Two of our colleagues in the Rapid Response Medical Unit even lost their lives in an attack,"" he added.

Still, officials say they have been able to vaccinate more than 27,000 high-risk contacts, of which at least half could have developed Ebola, which is spread through bodily fluids such as sweat, saliva and blood.

Separately, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) said this week that the main challenges in the current epidemic are insecurity and community mistrust.

""When there is an attack, the operation (vaccinations) actually freezes. And when the operation stops, the virus gets an advantage and it affects us in two ways,"" he told reporters in the DRC's capital, Kinshasa, on Thursday

""One is catching up on the backload. And the other, the second problem, is that more cases are generated because we can't vaccinate them,"" he said.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - The current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is the most severe in the country’s history with 319 confirmed and probable cases, the health ministry said late on Friday.

The hemorrhagic fever is believed to have killed 198 people in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, where attacks by armed groups and community resistance to health officials have complicated the response.

Congo has suffered 10 Ebola outbreaks since the virus was discovered near the eponymous Ebola River in 1976.

“The current epidemic is the worst in the history of DRC,” Jessica Ilunga, a spokeswoman for the ministry told Reuters.

With over 300 cases the epidemic also ranks as third worst in the history of the continent, following the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa where over 28,000 cases were confirmed and an outbreak in Uganda in 2000 involving 425 cases.

World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Thursday that security represented the primary challenge in the current epidemic, followed by community mistrust.

“When there is an attack, the operation actually freezes. So we hold the operation. And when the operation stops, the virus gets advantage and it affects us in two ways,” he told reporters in Kinshasa.

“And one is catching up on the backload. Because when operations are stopped, there is always a backload of vaccinations, or contact tracing. And the other, the second problem, is that more cases are generated because we can’t vaccinate them,” he said.

The ministry said it had recorded 201 deaths from the virus and that 291 cases have been confirmed since the outbreak began in August.

About half of the cases were in Beni, a city of 800,000 people, in the North Kivu region.

The UN's Department of Peacekeeping on Friday called on armed groups active in the region not to hinder efforts to fight the disease.

Teams responsible for responding to the outbreak ""have faced threats, physical assaults, repeated destruction of their equipment and kidnapping,"" Health Minister Oly Ilunga said on Friday.

""Two of our colleagues in the Rapid Response Medical Unit have even lost their lives in an attack,"" he said.

The outbreak is the tenth in DR Congo since Ebola was first detected there in 1976.

Ebola is a serious infectious disease that can spread rapidly through small amounts of bodily fluid, causing internal bleeding and potentially death.

Since a vaccination programme began on August 8, more than 25,000 people have been innoculated, the health ministry said earlier this month.

In other developments, plans are taking shape to test experimental Ebola treatments in clinical trials, and the United Kingdom is sending teams to assist with lab analysis and clinical trials.

New cases rise by 15

Of the 15 newly reported cases, 12 are confirmed and 3 are listed as probable. The total today stands at 334 cases, which includes 296 confirmed and 38 probable cases. Eight more deaths were reported over the past 3 days, lifting the fatality count to 206.

Of the latest illnesses, based on the health ministry's report for Nov 10 and yesterday, 6 are from Beni, 2 are from the security ""red zone"" city of Kalunguta, 1 is from Musienene, and 1 is from Kyondo, southeast of Butembo.

The other five cases, including three new probable illnesses, are reflected in totals the World Health Organization (WHO) listed today on its online dashboard, and the locations aren't specified. According to the latest information, health officials are still investigating 51 further suspected Ebola cases.

The number of people vaccinated continues to rise steadily, and as of yesterday, the health ministry said 28,727 had been immunized, roughly half of them in Beni.

More violence in Beni

Yesterday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said on Twitter that he had been briefed on a violent attack that occurred in Beni on the night of Nov 10.

""All WHO staff safe, but my heart goes out to families who have lost loved ones in this appalling and unacceptable attack, which we condemn in the strongest terms,"" he wrote.

According to a local media report translated and posted by H5N1 Blog, which focuses on infectious disease news, at least five civilians were killed and several children kidnapped in an attack by rebels with the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in Beni's Mayimoya district.

The report said two other people were killed in two other attacks the same day in Beni's Runwenzori neighborhood, one linked to ADF rebels and the other by suspected Mai Mai militia members.

Beni has experienced several violent attacks, one in September that led to a public mourning period and temporarily brought outbreak response actions to a standstill.

The fresh round of attacks comes on the heels of a high-level visit by WHO and United Nations peacekeeping officials to address security problems related to armed rebel groups and pockets of community mistrust that have been fueled by the failure of the DRC government to control land and protect citizens in the eastern part of the country where the outbreaks are occurring.

Study for therapies takes shape

In a report from Stat today, health officials said plans are coming together to launch a clinical trial in the outbreak region to test three antibody treatments and an antiviral drug against each other, a complex effort that is expended to extend across several future outbreaks in affected countries.

The experimental drugs are already being employed in Ebola treatment centers on a compassionate-use basis. They include three monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp, REGN 3470-3471-3479, and mAB 114) and the antiviral drug Remdesivir.

According to Stat, 139 patients have been treated with one of the four drugs.

Jamie Farrar, MD, PhD, director of the Wellcome Trust, told Stat that the randomized controlled trial will likely begin sometime in November and that the DRC's National Institute of Biomedical Research will be the trial sponsor. A final plan is waiting on a review of the study protocol by the DRC government's ethics advisors.

UK teams head for outbreak area

Experts from the United Kingdom are getting ready to travel to DRC, Sky News reported today, quoting Daniel Bausch, MD, MPH, who directs a rapid response team that is jointly run by Public Health England and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

He said the group will include two teams, one of them a six-person lab team that will help with genetic sequencing to better identify transmission patterns, and the other a two-person team to initially work on clinical trials.

According to the report, the teams are expected to arrive by the end of the week, arriving in Kinshasa and teaming up with colleagues from the WHO and the US National Institutes of Health. They will then travel to Beni if conditions are safe. Bausch said a senior epidemiologist had been in the outbreak region early in the epidemic for rapid risk assessment and is slated to return.

Nov 12 Sky News story",no result found,no result found,no result found,"A health worker gets ready to perform medical checks inside an Ebola treatment center in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Health officials are preparing to launch a clinical trial designed to test whether experimental Ebola therapies improve patients’ chances of survival in the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — a landmark moment in the world’s efforts to respond to this and future crises.

The randomized controlled trial will compare three different antibody treatments and an antiviral drug to each other, rather than involving a placebo. It is unlikely that the trial will produce clear results based on a single epidemic; it is expected to span several outbreaks and countries — a novel and challenging design.

In the current outbreak, the trial will be made all the more complicated by a difficult security environment.

“I don’t think the world quite appreciates the challenge of the environment in which this is happening,” said Dr. Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust and co-chair of a group that has been working under the auspices of the World Health Organization to draft the trial protocol.

“People are being shot at, and it’s not just the occasional bit of gunfire,” Farrar said of the security environment in North Kivu. “There’s mortars, there’s kidnappings — it is an intensely fragile environment with a lot of conflict that’s been going on for years.”

The four experimental therapies that will be tested have been used for weeks in Ebola treatment units being operated by nongovernmental organizations Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and Alima. Those therapeutics are the Gilead antiviral drug Remdesivir and three monoclonal antibody preparations: ZMapp, made by Mapp Biopharmaceuticals, Regeneron’s REGN 3470-3471-3479, and mAb 114, which is being developed by the National Institutes of Health and DRC’s National Institute of Biomedical Research.

As of Friday, 139 patients had received one of the four.

To date, there have been 329 confirmed and probable cases of Ebola and 205 deaths, making this Ebola outbreak, which began in July, the third largest on record.

It is unusual for unlicensed drugs to be used in such quantities outside of the context of a clinical trial. In this case, the authorization came through a sort of compassionate use protocol established by the WHO.

The idea was that the protocol would serve as a bridge to allow use while a clinical trial was being designed and signed off on by the numerous parties that have a stake in the process. But that process has taken longer than many people anticipated, and there has been frustration and concern about continued use of experimental drugs that have been shown to increase survival in animal studies, but may or may not work as well in people.

“We need to start randomizing. We need to start generating evidence and having a harmonized way of collecting data,” said Dr. Annick Antierens, MSF’s medical department strategic adviser, who has been involved in the negotiations.

There have been some data gathered from the cases treated to date, but without any kind of standardization, it’s not clear how much can be deduced from it. Antierens likened it to comparing “apples with cherries and leeks and melons.”

Dr. Mike Ryan, deputy head of the WHO’s emergency response operation, insisted this period of compassionate use has allowed the Ebola treatment centers to get to the point where they are functioning well, and has given their staff time to become familiar with how to administer the drugs. ZMapp is difficult to use; it takes three infusions, given over hours. If patients are treated with Remdesivir, their liver function must be analyzed regularly.

“Both NGOs and the Congolese doctors and nurses have had this clinical experience over the weeks,” said Ryan, who spent the last month in the outbreak zone. “It’s a mechanical process and it requires a skill. And you get that muscle memory from doing that and you become more and more comfortable.”

“You don’t just push the ‘RCT button’ in a context like this, you know?” he added, using an acronym for randomized controlled trials.

The trial is expected to start soon, likely in November, Farrar said — with Congo’s National Institute of Biomedical Research serving as the sponsor for the trial.

But there remain details to be worked out. An ethics committee advising the Congolese government is still reviewing the protocol.

The protocol is written in such a way as to allow countries a little flexibility. While DRC has indicated it will run four arms — meaning all patients will be randomized to receive one of the drugs — other countries will have the option to add a control arm that would allow the drugs to be compared to standard care.

Antierens said there’s a problem with that idea. There is no one standard of care for Ebola, she said, and none of the interventions used in the treatment of Ebola patients has been proved to actually improve survival. That’s not to say they don’t help, only that there have never been clinical trials to show they do.

In the case of the Ebola therapeutics, if there is no control arm, how do you compare four different therapies? One idea has been to use ZMapp — which was studied in the West African outbreak — as an “anchor arm,” comparing the other drugs to it.

The ZMapp trial appeared to generate a signal that patients who were infused with the antibody cocktail were more likely to survive, but the trial was started late in the outbreak and did not manage to enroll enough patients to come to a conclusive answer. Not everyone is on board with the notion of using ZMapp as an anchor arm, Antierens said.

Another possibility, said Dr. Marie-Pierre Preziosi, is to compare the three monoclonal antibody treatments to each other, and to compare the monoclonals to the antiviral. Preziosi is one of the leads of a WHO program designed to spur development of medical countermeasures for disease threats that don’t attract commercial pharmaceutical manufacturers.

A data safety monitoring board will review results at preset intervals. If any of the drugs don’t appear to be working — or conversely appear to be much more effective than the others — the board will advise the trial team on whether to drop a drug or discontinue the trial, Preziosi said.

Given the difficulty of conducting clinical trials during an Ebola outbreak — let alone an Ebola outbreak in such a highly volatile setting — this needs to be done right, Ryan said.

“I do think we need a period of solid operational and logistics planning in the field to make this a success. Everyone wants this to be a success,” he added. “Everyone wants a good RCT to finally work out what value each of these therapies has in the treatment of of Ebola. We’ve seen promising signs … but no one will ever know until we do a proper RCT.”"

In other developments, in updates yesterday and today the DRC's health ministry reported eight new cases along with four more deaths from the disease.

Latest cases include 4 in security red zone

In its daily update yesterday, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) health ministry said two new cases were reported in Beni, and another person from Butembo had died from the disease.

Then in an update today, officials reported six more cases, which include one in Butembo, one in Katwa health zone, and four in Kalunguta, which is in a security ""red zone"" area. Also today, the health ministry reported three more Ebola deaths, all in Butembo, the urban outbreak hot spot.

Based on adjustments to the Ebola database, the health ministry said yesterday that Ebola totals have changed slightly and now reflect three more probable cases. As of today, the new numbers reflect 339 cases, including 301 confirmed and 38 probable. The fatality count is at 212.

Health officials are investigating 43 suspected Ebola infections.

In yesterday's update, the health ministry said attacks that occurred Sunday in the Boikene area near Beni temporarily halted Ebola vaccination activities yesterday, but it noted today that immunization has resumed.

Spread to more geographic areas

The WHO's African regional office update focuses on 31 cases and 19 deaths reported since Nov 2. Over the past week, three new health zones have reported confirmed cases. They include a case confirmed on Nov 7 from Mutwanga health zone near the Uganda border, an illness confirmed on Nov 8 from Kyondo health zone near Butembo, and an infection confirmed on Nov 9 from Musienene health zone, an area that had previously recorded a probable case.

Two more health worker infections were reported on Nov 9, raising the total number of health workers infected in the outbreak to 30, including 3 deaths.

Insecurity and persistent community resistance still pose problems for contact tracing, but as of Nov 10, the proportion of contacts followed was 94%, the WHO said.

""The EVD outbreak continues to be of grave concern, particularly with geographical spread of the disease to new areas, as well as the increasing number of confirmed cases and contacts to be followed,"" the WHO said. It added that a plan for strengthening infection prevention and control in Beni and other areas needs to be put in place, along with continued collaboration with Mai Mai groups in Kalunguta, a security ""red zone"", to help with the investigation of deaths in the community and in hospitals and to follow up with contact vaccination.

Attacks by armed groups in Beni and surrounding areas continue to pose a major security threat, officials said.

""It's very hard to predict timeframes in an outbreak as complicated as this with so many variables that are outside our control, but certainly we're planning on at least another six months before we can declare this outbreak over,"" Salama said yesterday.

The outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces is now more than 100 days old, and the largest Ebola outbreak the DRC has ever seen.

Today, the DRC's ministry of health recorded two more cases and three more deaths since yesterday—all in Beni—bringing the total number of cases to 341 and the total number of deaths to 215. Fifty suspected cases are under investigation.

WHO details cases among newborns

Yesterday the WHO released its latest situation report on the outbreak, noting that among the 31 cases diagnosed from Nov 5 to 11, seven involved newborn babies. Three cases were also diagnosed in pregnant or breastfeeding women and three in healthcare workers.

To date, women have made up 62% of patients in the outbreak, and 30 healthcare workers have been infected, 3 fatally.

Also in the past week, the virus has spread to new towns, including Kyondo (about 18 miles southeast of Butembo) and Mutwanga (about 31 miles southeast of Beni), the current epicenters of the outbreak.

""Overall trends in the outbreak reflect the continuation of transmission in several cities and villages in North Kivu. Given the persisting delays in case detection and the ongoing data reconciliation activities, trends in weekly incidence (especially in the most recent weeks) must be interpreted cautiously,"" the WHO said.

The WHO said workers on the ground are receiving an average of 191 alerts for possible Ebola cases each day, and typically 46 are validated as cases needing further investigation.

Beni remains the most affected city in the DRC, with 100 deaths. Mabalako, the first village to be affected by the outbreak, has reported 61 deaths. The outbreak zone is one of the most populous and dangerous regions of the DRC, where more than 1 million internally displaced people live and dozens of armed militia groups are based.

The WHO said the global risk of Ebola in this outbreak is low but maintained that regional risk to neighboring countries like Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania is high.

Vaccine efforts

Finally, Stat reported yesterday that Merck is applying for US Food and Drug Administration approval for its unlicensed Ebola vaccine, currently being used in the DRC.

The vaccine, provisionally being called V920, was used during the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016 and earlier this year in another outbreak in the DRC.

A total of 30,072 people in the DRC and Uganda have been vaccinated with Merck's vaccine during this current outbreak, the DRC health ministry said. The WHO said 13 vaccination rings exist in the affected health zones.

Nov 14 DRC update

Nov 13 WHO situation report

Nov 13 Stat story","The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is facing its worst Ebola outbreak in the country's recorded history, health officials have said.

The announcement late on Friday came amid increasing warnings that the situation could deteriorate because of attacks by armed groups and community resistance in the affected areas in eastern DRC.

Oly Ilunga Kalenga, the DRC's health minister, said a total of 319 confirmed and probable cases have been reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces since the outbreak was declared in August.

The figure exceeds the 318 cases documented in 1976, when the deadly Ebola virus was first identified in Yambuku, in the Equateur province.

{articleGUID}

Kalenga said 198 deaths have been recorded so far in the current outbreak, the country's 10th, including 165 confirmed cases, with 35 probable deaths. Of the 284 confirmed cases, 97 have survived.

""This epidemic remains dangerous and unpredictable, and we must not let our guard down,"" Kalenga said in a statement.

""We must continue to pursue a very dynamic response that requires permanent readjustments and real ownership at the community level.""

'World's most complex epidemic'

But the medical response has been complicated by regular attacks by armed groups battling for control in the mineral-rich eastern parts of the country.

Health officials have also reported cases of community resistance.

""No other epidemic in the world has been as complex as the one we are currently experiencing,"" said Kalenga.

According to the minister, the teams responding to the outbreak are attacked on average three or four times a week, in an unprecedented level of violence compared with the country's nine previous outbreaks.

{articleGUID}

""Since their arrival in the region, the response teams have faced threats, physical assaults, repeated destruction of their equipment and kidnapping,"" said Kalenga.

""Two of our colleagues in the Rapid Response Medical Unit even lost their lives in an attack,"" he added.

Still, officials say they have been able to vaccinate more than 27,000 high-risk contacts, of which at least half could have developed Ebola, which is spread through bodily fluids such as sweat, saliva and blood.

Separately, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) said this week that the main challenges in the current epidemic are insecurity and community mistrust.

""When there is an attack, the operation (vaccinations) actually freezes. And when the operation stops, the virus gets an advantage and it affects us in two ways,"" he told reporters in the DRC's capital, Kinshasa, on Thursday

""One is catching up on the backload. And the other, the second problem, is that more cases are generated because we can't vaccinate them,"" he said.

The confirmation of new cases has accelerated in the last month and an emergency committee of WHO experts said in October that the outbreak was likely to worsen significantly unless the response was stepped up.",no result found,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The Ebola outbreak in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which has already killed more than 200 people, is expected to last until mid-2019, a senior World Health Organization official said on Tuesday.

“It’s very hard to predict timeframes in an outbreak as complicated as this with so many variables that are outside our control, but certainly we’re planning on at least another six months before we can declare this outbreak over,” WHO emergency response chief Peter Salama told reporters.

The outbreak in Congo’s North Kivu province has caused 333 confirmed and probable cases of the deadly virus, and is now the worst in Congo’s history.

The location of the disease is perhaps the most difficult the WHO has ever encountered, due to a dense and mobile local population, insecurity caused by two armed groups, and its spread by transmission in health centers, Salama said.

One of the major drivers of the spread of the disease was due to people visiting the several hundred “tradi-modern” health centers in the town of Beni, he said.

“Those facilities, we believe, are one of the major drivers of transmission,” he said.

The tradi-modern facilities were unregulated, informal, and varied from being a standalone structure to a room in someone’s house, and were not set up to spot Ebola, let alone tackle cases of the disease.

Many had no running water for handwashing, and patients - who generally opted for injectable medicine because they felt it gave them a stronger form of medicine - would reuse needles.

“With the injections come the risks,” Salama said.

There had been an epidemiological breakthrough around late October, when a change in the age distribution of Ebola patients revealed that many of them were children being treated for malaria in the tradi-modern health centers.",no result found
15-Nov-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

New measures to overcome obstacles in responding to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are having a positive impact. The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to be confident that, despite challenges, the outbreak can be contained.

Over the past week (7 – 13 November), transmission continued in several areas of North Kivu Province, while a geographical expansion of the outbreak to two new health zones (Kyondo and Mutwanga) was observed (Figure 1). The first cases reported from these health zones were exposed through contact with cases in Butembo and Beni, respectively.

During the reporting period, 31 new confirmed EVD cases were reported from Beni, Mutwanga, Kalunguta, Butembo, Vuhovi, Kyondo and Musienene. Four of the new cases were newborn babies and infants aged less than two years, three were children aged between 2 – 17 years and three were women who were pregnant or breastfeeding. Three health workers from Beni and Butembo were among the newly infected; 31 health workers have been infected to date. Twelve additional survivors were discharged from Beni (nine), Butembo (two) and Mabalako (one) Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) and reintegrated into their communities; 103 patients have recovered to date.

During the past week, a review and reconciliation of case records was conducted. This review resulted in the addition of 14 probable cases, invalidation of 11 past deaths previously reported as probable cases and exclusion of duplicate cases. In addition, some confirmed and probable cases were recategorized to health zones where their infection most likely occurred, as opposed to the location of the ETC where they were admitted.

As of 13 November, 341 EVD cases (303 confirmed and 38 probable), including 215 deaths (177 confirmed and 38 probable)1, have been reported in 11 health zones in North Kivu Province and three health zones in Ituri Province (Figure 1). The overall trends in weekly case incidence reflect the continuation of community transmission in several cities and villages in North Kivu (Figure 2). Given the expected delays in case detection and ongoing data reconciliation activities, trends, especially in the most recent weeks, must be interpreted cautiously.

The risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains very high. Over the course of the past week, alerts have been reported from South Sudan and Uganda; EVD has been ruled out for all alerts to date. The vaccination of health and frontline workers at priority sites in Uganda began on 7 November, and preparations are ongoing for the vaccination of health and frontline workers in Rwanda and South Sudan.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries.

For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, see the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country, which border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO’s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The IHR Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Study: Novel antiviral pimodivir cuts viral load in patients with influenza A

A phase 2 trial of the novel antiviral drug pimodivir found reductions in viral load when given alone or with oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for patients with influenza A infections and was well tolerated. An international research team reported its findings yesterday in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Pimodivir, developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, is a polymerase inhibitor that blocks the PB2 subunit of influenza A viruses. Polymerase inhibitors signify a new antiviral class that also includes favipiravir and baloxavir. In 2017, pimodivir received US Food and Drug Administration fast-track designation.

In the double-blind phase 2b study, 223 adults with uncomplicated influenza A were randomized to receive one of four treatments twice a day for 5 days: placebo, pimodivir 300 milligrams (mg) or 600 mg, or 600 mg pimodivir with 75 mg oseltamivir.

Patients who received the pimodivir-oseltamivir combination had significantly lower viral loads than those who received 600 mg pimodivir alone. Though the finding was not statistically significant, the researchers saw a trend of greater clinical improvement in patients who received the 600 mg of pimodivir alone or with oseltamivir. Mild and transient diarrhea was the most common adverse effect.

The authors concluded that the promising virologic findings, with or without oseltamivir, support further development of the pimodivir given at the 600 mg dose.

In a commentary on the study in the same issue, two infectious disease experts wrote that the results of the trial are promising and show possible synergistic effects with oseltamivir, but future studies will need to confirm if this translates into a clinical benefit. The authors are Nelson Lee, MD, MBBS, professor in the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alberta, and Michael Ison, MD, with Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.

The experts added, however, that researchers should keep a close eye on the emergence of genetic variants when patients are treated with polymerase inhibitors. Lee and Ison concluded that the new antiviral class may prove to have important roles for treating severe flu, as well as infections caused by viruses resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors like oseltamivir.

Restaurant inspection grades tied to reduced Salmonella rates in New York

Posting health inspection letter grades at restaurants was associated with a lower incidence of Salmonella in New York City, according to a new study in Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Researchers compared Salmonella rates in New York City (NYC) and the rest of the state (ROS) after health department letter grading was put into place (from 2011 to 2016), to rates of the infectious foodborne pathogen from before the letter system was used (2006 to 2010), noting a 5.3% drop per year in the city following the implementation of the letter grading system.

""The period-to-period percent change after letter grading implementation was a decline of 32.6% in NYC, compared with a decline of 14.1% in the ROS,"" the authors said. In the period after letter grading was implemented, the mean rate of Salmonella infection was no longer significantly different (P = 0.37) in NYC (mean 12.6 cases/100,000 persons; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.9–14.4) compared with the ROS (mean 12.0 cases/100,000 persons; 95% CI, 11.4–12.6), because the rate in NYC was higher than the ROS initially.

""NYC's experience provides a useful case study of the beneficial effect of letter grading programs,"" concluded the authors, Melanie J. Firestone and Craig Hedberg, PhD, of the University of Minnesota. ""Although the relationship between restaurant inspections and risk for foodborne illness is not well understood and inspections represent a snapshot in time that may not represent the overall sanitary conditions in restaurants, factors related to food handling and preparation practices and food worker health and hygiene are frequent contributors to outbreaks in restaurants.""

Ten other peacekeeping troops were wounded, and another is missing, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in New York.

Several Congolese were also killed or wounded in the joint operation, he said.

The deaths mark the biggest loss by the large UN force in DR Congo since the rebels killed 15 troops nearly a year ago.

Earlier Thursday, General Bernard Commins, deputy head of the MONUSCO force, said a joint operation had been launched with DRC troops on Tuesday against the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a jihadist group blamed for bloody attacks on civilians.

The offensive aimed at Kididiwe, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Beni, a city of between 200,000 and 300,000 inhabitants, said Commins.

“We are holding Kididiwe at present, after violent fighting with an armed group. At present, we are evacuating wounded Congolese troops and Blue Helmets,” he told AFP.

Blue helmets from Malawi, Tanzania

Six peacekeepers from Malawi and one from Tanzania were killed, the UN said in New York.

Malawi’s armed forces confirmed earlier that four of its soldiers with MONUSCO – a sergeant and three privates aged between 29 and 38 – had been killed on Wednesday.

The military “has lost courageous, hardworking and disciplined soldiers who were always ready to serve to ensure that peace prevails,” the Malawi Defence Force said in a statement.

It gave no further details on where or how they died.

Commins described Kididiwe as a “major stronghold” of the ADF.

A Congolese officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the town had been used as a springboard for militia attacks on Beni’s suburbs this year.

On Wednesday, Commins said MONUSCO had deployed attack helicopters against ADF forces threatening UN troops in the Mayangose area, northeast of Beni.

Beni and the surrounding villages are also suffering from an Ebola epidemic that has infected over 300 people and killed two thirds of them.

This makes it the third worst outbreak ever after a 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa when 28,000 people were infected and in Uganda in 2000 when there were 425 cases.

Constant armed attacks by at least two rebel groups in the region are hampering international efforts to contain the virus, by preventing medical workers from gaining access to Ebola victims.

Notorious militia

The ADF is an Islamist-rooted group that rose in western Uganda in 1995, led by Jamil Mukulu, a Christian turned Muslim.

Forced out of Uganda, it operates in the border area in the DRC’s North Kivu province.

It has been blamed for recruiting and using child soldiers, killing hundreds of civilians since 2014, as well as 15 Tanzanian peacekeepers who died in an attack in December 2017.

Those fatalities were the biggest loss of life in a UN peacekeeping force since 1993 when 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed in Somalia during clashes with a local warlord.

On Monday, MONUSCO’s head, Leila Zerrougui, sounded the alarm over violence in the eastern DRC, saying it cast a shadow over the country’s elections on December 23.

“I have grown increasingly alarmed over the situation in Beni in recent months, where we continue to face major challenges in implementing our mandate,” she added.

“There is a potential for armed group interference in elections in specific areas throughout eastern DRC,” she said.

MONUSCO has around 17,000 members, making it one of the UN’s biggest peacekeeping operations. Created in 1999 during the Second Congo War, it has an annual budget of $1.153 billion (1.02 billion euros).

(FRANCE 24 with AFP and REUTERS)","GOMA, Congo (Reuters) - At least seven U.N. peacekeepers were killed in clashes with militias in an area that is at the center of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s worst Ebola epidemic, United Nations and diplomatic sources said on Thursday.

“Our peacekeeping colleagues tell us that six peacekeepers from Malawi and one from Tanzania who are part of the U.N. peacekeeping operation in the DRC ... were killed yesterday, in Beni territory, in North Kivu,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York.

Eastern Congo has been plagued by banditry and armed insurrections for more than two decades since the fall of military ruler Mobutu Sese Seko, but the past year has seen a surge in violence around North Kivu.

Action targeted ADF stronghold

The action against the armed rebels, who have been responsible for several attacks against civilians in Beni that have stymied response activities, involved the UN mission known as MONUSCO and government armed forces. Their target was the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).

Forces killed in the clash included one Tanzanian and six Malawian ""blue helmets,"" or UN soldiers, according to a UN report. Ten other peacekeepers were wounded, and another is missing. Several government soldiers and an unknown number of ADF fighters were also killed or wounded.

According to a New York Times report, the joint forces came under attack while trying to remove rebel fighters from a stronghold in Kididiwe near Beni. UN officials speaking anonymously told the Times that the mission was successful, and a number of rebels were taken.

In a statement, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the killing of the UN peacekeepers and called on armed groups to disarm and stop their destabilizing activities, which hurt the local population and complicate the Ebola outbreak response.

He also urged the DRC's government to keep taking steps to apprehend those responsible for attacks on civilians, government forces, and UN peacekeeping troops.

Beni has been the scene of several violent attacks since the Ebola outbreak began in August, including one in September that resulted in a public mourning period that temporarily halted response operations.

The joint mission push against the ADF forces in the area comes a week after a high-level visit by UN and World Health Organization (WHO) officials to address the security problems, which have been fueled by the DRC's longstanding failure to protect citizens against armed groups in the eastern part of the country.

One confirmed case, more probable illnesses

Meanwhile, the DRC's health ministry today reported one new case, which involves a patient from Katwa. Officials have been cleaning up their case database, which has resulted in the addition of seven probable cases in Kalunguta.

The new developments bring the outbreak total to 352 cases, 305 of them confirmed and 47 listed as probable. One more death was reported, which involves a person from Katwa, lifting the fatality count to 210.

Health officials are currently investigating 90 suspected Ebola cases, which is double the number the health ministry said they were investigating yesterday.

In an update on vaccination efforts, the health ministry said it has used a different strategy to immunize people in Kalunguta, a ""red zone"" where the security situation doesn't allow investigators to establish a contact list needed for the ring vaccination strategy used elsewhere in the outbreak region.

Instead, health officials have used a targeted geographic vaccination strategy, which consists of vaccinating several households or even a whole village or district around a confirmed case.

Overall, 31,224 people have been vaccinated, about half of them in Beni and 1,620 in the Kalunguta red zone.

Beni (DR Congo) (AFP)

The World Health Organization (WHO) said Saturday that 16 staff members have been temporarily evacuated from DR Congo's restive eastern city of Beni after a shell hit the building they were staying in.

The incident occurred in the Ebola-plagued region during clashes between UN peacekeepers from the MONUSCO mission and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia on Friday night.

""It was in exchanges of fire that the house was hit by a shell"", Michel Yao, WHO's co-ordinator for Ebola response operations in Beni, told AFP.

No one was injured, he said, adding that it was not known whether the shell came from the militia, the UN peacekeepers or the Congolese army backing them.

The 16 WHO workers, out of a total of 191 in Beni, were ""traumatised"" and left for the eastern city of Goma on Saturday to ""de-stress"", Yao said.

""It's a two-storey house and the staff took refuge downstairs. The shell landed on the roof of a toilet,"" he said.

It was the first time WHO has had to evacuate staff from Beni, where an Ebola outbreak has killed 213 people since August 1.

Earlier Saturday, DR Congo's health ministry announced that efforts to fight the deadly virus in Beni had been suspended after clashes just a ""few metres"" from a local emergency centre and hotels of several response teams.

The ministry said that the UN and army forces had repelled the attack by the ADF, a shadowy armed group that has killed hundreds of people since 2014 and at least seven peacekeepers in clashes just this week.

Ebola response suffers another setback, as WHO evacuates some staff after attack

The World Health Organization has evacuated 16 people working to contain the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo following a rebel attack near the area where they were staying, Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Saturday.

The decision marks another violence-related setback for the response to the outbreak, but Tedros said in an interview with STAT that he hoped containment operations could resume as normal soon.

Overall, the response team in the area comprises more than 200 health workers and others, he said.

The attack appears to have targeted a camp used by United Nations peacekeeping forces in Beni, a city in northeastern Congo that is currently a hot spot for Ebola transmission. The camp is located near a hotel where some Ebola responders are staying.

Tedros said leaders of the response operation called him to inform him an attack was underway on Friday night, and he could hear heavy gunfire over the phone.

“They called me immediately and the gunfire was very close to them,” he said.

After Friday night’s violence subsided, several members of the Ebola response team “were exhibiting some distress,” Tedros said, and a decision was made to pull them back to Goma, a city south of Beni, so that they could get a few days of rest and counseling. Others insisted on staying in Beni, he said, calling them “very courageous people.”

Friday’s violence was the latest in a string of attacks in the region. Earlier in the week eight peacekeepers and at least 12 Congolese soldiers died in an ambush on their joint operation aimed at routing out a stronghold of the rebel group Allied Democratic Forces near Beni. A number of rebels were captured in the exchange.

That event again prompted the U.N. to call for a halt to the violence in the region, suggesting attacks on the peacekeepers may be deemed war crimes under international law.

The Ebola outbreak response has been struggling because of the violence in the region and the distrust it fosters among people in the region who have lived with these conditions for years.

Repeated bouts of violence have hampered the ability of the response teams to do their work, and the virus has taken advantage of their limitations.

As of Saturday there have been 358 confirmed and probable cases in this outbreak, and 213 of those people have died. It is the third largest Ebola outbreak on record and the largest in Congo’s long history with Ebola outbreaks.

Last week Dr. Peter Salama, who heads the WHO’s emergency response program, suggested it will take at least another six months to contain the outbreak in DRC.

The director general noted that containment team operations resumed Saturday, but on a somewhat reduced scale. Efforts to vaccinate people who have been in contact with Ebola cases were suspended for the day. “If tonight is OK, they will continue with vaccination tomorrow,” Tedros said.

The director general said that the Ebola response team asked for more protection and that he had discussions with the head of the peacekeeping operation as well as with Jean-Pierre Lacroix, the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping operations.

“They’re putting more troops and maximizing the protection. So we will use all the means we have … to protect all humanitarian workers there,” Tedros said."

Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga had announced the suspension of operations on Saturday, a day after clashes broke out a few a ""few metres"" away from a local emergency centre and the hotels of several responses teams in Beni, North Kivu province.

Peacekeepers from the United Nations' mission in the country (MONUSCO) repelled an offensive by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia in the city's northern Boikene neighbourhood late on Friday.

Seven Malawian and one Tanzanian peacekeeper were killed in the attack.

Also on Saturday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said 16 of its staff members had been temporarily evacuated to Goma for psychological care after a shell hit the building they were staying in.



Michel Yao, the WHO's coordinator for Ebola response operations in Beni, told the AFP news agency that no one was wounded, adding that it was not known whether the shell came from the ADF or MONUSCO forces.

""WHO will continue to work side-by-side with the ministry and our partners to bring this Ebola outbreak to an end,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.



""We honour the memory of those who have died battling this outbreak, and deplore the continuing threats on the security of those still working to end it,"" he added.

United Nations also resumed activities, including vaccination, the UN health agency said in a statement.

The latest Ebola outbreak, the country's 10th, has caused 166 confirmed and 47 probable deaths, mostly in the mineral-rich North Kivu and Ituri provinces that have been the epicentre of interethnic and militia violence for decades.

Worst outbreak

According to the WHO, a total of 358 confirmed and probable cases have been reported in the country.

The figure exceeds the 318 cases documented in 1976, when the virus was first identified in Yambuku, in the Equateur province.

""No other epidemic in the world has been as complex as the one we are currently experiencing,"" Oly Ilunga said last week, adding that the teams responding to the outbreak are attacked on average three or four times a week, in an unprecedented level of violence compared with the country's nine previous outbreaks.

""Since their arrival in the region, the response teams have faced threats, physical assaults, repeated destruction of their equipment and kidnapping,"" Oly Ilunga.

On Saturday, a ceremony was held for the peacekeepers who were killed in the previous night's attack.



Fifteen other peacekeepers were killed in an ADF assault on a MONUSCO base in Beni in December 2017.

The armed group was formed in neighbouring Uganda in the 1990s. Forced out of Uganda, it operates in the border area in the DRC's North Kivu province.

Over the weekend and through today, the DRC recorded 21 more cases of Ebola, for a total of 373 cases, including 216 deaths. Seventy-two cases are suspected and under investigation.

The World Health Organization (WHO) evacuated 16 people after their residence was hit by a shell that did not explode, and Ebola surveillance and vaccination efforts were stalled in Beni for at least 24 hours.

According to the DRC's health ministry, the clash lasted several hours and took place a few meters away from the Ebola emergency operations center and hotels housing several response teams.

""Vaccination was suspended and the operations centre was closed, but teams still went out into the communities to follow up on some alerts of potential cases, to meet contacts and ensure they are still well, and to bring sick people to treatment centres. The treatment centers, which are run by partners, remained operational,"" the WHO said.

Beni has been the epicenter of the current Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, which has been going on for more than 4 months and has become the DRC's largest Ebola outbreak to date. The outbreak area encompasses the DRC's most unsettled region, home to more than 1 million refugees and dozens of militia.

DRC reassures about commitment

The DRC's ministry of health reassured people over the weekend and today that despite the evacuation, the efforts to end the outbreak in North Kivu are still ongoing.

""The field activities in Beni did not take place normally at the beginning of the day on Saturday 17 November. After assessing the security situation, all field activities, except vaccination, were able to resume idling on Saturday afternoon,"" the DRC's health ministry said yesterday.

Today, Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe, MD, the DRC's coordinator of response efforts, gave a press briefing in Beni. He said there are still more than 900 health workers in the city, including 191 WHO workers and consultants.

The DRC said full vaccination had resumed yesterday, and as of today, a total of 32,108 people had been vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine, including 15,962 in Beni.

Outbreak grows in Kalunguta

Bathe also addressed the recent cases in Kalunguta, a health district in one of the DRC's security red zones. He explained that Ebola was spread to the area by a confirmed case-patient from Beni who escaped surveillance in that city. Bathe said the community has been accommodating to health workers, and more than 800 people have been vaccinated.

At least 2 of the 21 new cases recorded this weekend were in Kalunguta.

In updates over the weekend, the DRC's health ministry efforts to clean up the Ebola case database were continuing.

Nov 17 WHO statement",no result found,no result found,no result found,"WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in June.

The public health workers behind the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are struggling to combat an outbreak of the deadly virus in what is effectively a war zone. Repeated rebel attacks on the city of Beni — the outbreak epicenter and the headquarters of the response operation — have given the virus an advantage over the humans trying to contain it, acknowledges Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director-general.

The most recent attack, on Friday, targeted a military encampment close to a hotel in Beni where some Ebola responders are housed. The hotel was hit by a shell that did not detonate. In the aftermath, a decision was made the next day to evacuate 16 personnel experiencing emotional distress and to insist on heightened security from the United Nations peacekeeping force in the area, known as MONUSCO.

STAT caught up over the weekend with the WHO director-general, who traveled to Beni earlier this month. We asked Tedros, as he is known, about the WHO’s ongoing battle against Ebola in North Kivu province and whether a global health emergency should be declared.

As of Sunday, there have been 366 confirmed and probable Ebola infections reported in this outbreak; 214 of those people died.

The interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

Do you have a sense for whether the Ebola response team was a target of the rebels? Or is it just that they are in the line of fire, because of where they are headquartered in Beni, so close to the U.N. peacekeepers?

They were attacking the MONUSCO camp. I checked with MONUSCO Commander General Elias Martins Filho. He said the hotels where our response teams are were not attacked.

How is it for you? You said you are proud of these people, and it’s understandable why, but at some point somebody could die there. It’s a very, very dangerous situation.

Yes, it’s tough. … We have almost constant discussion with my colleagues there. And what they’re asking for now is maximum protection. And I even asked them: OK, what do you want? And they said: more boots on the ground. And more protection, so there is this deterrent effect.

So that’s exactly what they’re doing now. MONUSCO is already mobilizing. They’re increasing their troop level today.

What more could the world do to help WHO get this job done?

We’re getting the support we need, to be honest, from the international community. One is funding; it’s OK. Because the outbreak took longer than we expected, we may need more. But I’m very confident that we will get what we need.

And second is the protection. And as you know the MONUSCO troops have even sacrificed their lives. The other is, more importantly, the commitment of the government is strong, too.

But the attacks have increased since Ebola started, both in intensity and frequency. So it’s a very dangerous situation.

The insecurity is a virus. And there is another virus, Ebola. Managing two viruses at the same time is tough but at the same time, we’re having an impact.

Some people think this outbreak should be declared a PHEIC — a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Are you thinking of reconvening the WHO’s Ebola Emergency Committee, which met in October , to advise you on whether the outbreak should be declared be a PHEIC?

That committee met recently. I think things have not really changed significantly from then. I think it’s better, based on our discussions with the [U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations], to see how the situation will be handled. We’re just starting. And they’re giving it their best. And if necessary, they will do even more.

If there is a change that needs another convening of the Emergency Committee, of course, I will convene. But at this point, I don’t see that it will add any value. Because even if they [propose] temporary recommendations, how different will it be from what we have now?

What would be gained from declaring a PHEIC? Is there something that you need that you can’t get because it’s not a PHEIC?

To be honest, I’m not missing anything I have asked for. That’s why the Emergency Committee also was not convinced we need to call it a PHEIC.

[International] partners, they call me. And they ask if we need anything. The U.K., the European Union, Germany — almost everybody. USAID, the same. They want to support if there is a need. The U.S. government. Wellcome Trust. They are ready.

What about in terms of personnel? The U.S. government will not allow its employees to go near the epicenter, because they say it’s too unsafe. Is that a disappointment?

They’re following their security rules. So to be honest, I cannot say anything about that, because they have to follow their rules. But they’re supporting us financially, so we can deploy people. I don’t think the personnel issue is a problem.

Of course it would be good if they could join us. But I don’t think they will be able to change the security provisions easily.

You have enough volunteers through the global health alert and response network?

We can get as many as we want. No problem in personnel.

There are supposed to be elections in DRC next month. Are you concerned that as the elections approach the violence might increase?

It’s very difficult to say. But what we’re doing is we’re working with the government to have infection prevention and control measures included in the preparation for the election, for instance in polling stations and so on.

During elections sometimes Ebola or other problems could be used politically. We’re trying to pass a message to everybody that the virus is an enemy to everybody. It’s dangerous to everybody. So no need to politicize that. We have directly and indirectly spoken to both the parties and I hope they will cooperate.

I guess what you need is for some peace and quiet, so your team can do its job. Is that it?

Exactly. That’s why I say the insecurity itself is a virus, because it’s helping the virus [Ebola] to propagate.

The two problems together really complicate the operation, because there will be inaccessible areas that we cannot reach. But not only that: When there is an attack … we may hold or stop our response for two days or so. During that time, the virus gets an advantage."

In its daily update on its Ebola outbreak, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) health ministry today reported no new confirmed cases, though it did report one more death in a patient from Beni, the outbreak's main hot spot.

Also, officials said 71 suspected Ebola cases are still under investigation. The latest developments keep the overall case total at 373, which includes 326 confirmed and 47 probable cases. The new fatality raises the number of deaths to 217. The previous 3 days saw 21 new cases.

In other developments, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office today, in its weekly outbreak and health emergencies update, said over the past 21 days, Beni, Kalunguta, and Katwa have been the main hotspots. It added that against a backdrop of escalating insecurity, the outbreak remains dangerous and unpredictable.

The agency said there's a critical need to strengthen infection prevention and control in Beni and other areas and to continue collaborating with Mai Mai rebel groups regarding security in the Kalunguta red zone to help with death investigations, follow-up, and vaccination.

The report notes that bed occupancy in Beni's Ebola treatment center is at full capacity. It said 39 healthcare workers have been sickened in the outbreak, 11 of them fatally, signifying an increase of 9 cases and 8 deaths.

New York, New Jersey report more measles cases in ongoing outbreaks

Both New York state and New Jersey confirmed more measles cases in ongoing outbreaks, according to updates from health departments in Rockland County, N.Y., and Ocean County, N.J.

In New York, 10 more cases have been confirmed in Rockland County, raising that outbreak total to 76. And 3 more cases of measles have been confirmed in Ocean County, bringing New Jersey's total to 14. An additional 13 cases are under investigation.

The New York outbreak has been traced to an international traveler who visited Rockland County in September. The cases are clustered in eastern Ramapo, but officials warned that the virus could easily spread throughout the small county, which borders New York City.

In New Jersey, the Ocean County health department said it supported and encouraged the exclusion of unvaccinated children from schools, playdates, and daycare in the outbreak area.

Officials said all children 6 months to 11 months old should get their first dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and all other children should be up to date on MMR vaccination. They warned that unvaccinated children exposed to measles are at great risk of contracting the virus.

WHO details 4 recent Saudi MERS infections

The WHO today fleshed out more details about four MERS-CoV cases, one of them fatal, reported by Saudi Arabia in the last half of October.

All four of the patients are men ages 53 to 74 who had underlying medical conditions, and none were healthcare workers. None of the men had known contact with an earlier confirmed case.

Three are from Riyadh, two of whom had drunk camel milk before they got sick. Contact with camels or camel products is a well known risk for MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus). The fatality occurred on Nov 1 in the oldest, a 74-year-old patient from Riyadh who was one of the men who drank camel milk.

The fourth case involves a 62-year-old man from Tabuk in the northwest of the country.

Notification of more cases doesn't change the overall risk assessment, the WHO said, adding that it expects more cases to be reported in the Middle East, with sporadic exported cases involving people who are exposed to animals, animal products, and sick people, such as those in health settings.

Since the virus was first detected in humans in 2012, the WHO has received reports of 2,266 cases, at least 804 of them fatal.

Emergent, Valneva report initial results for human Zika vaccine trial

Emergent BioSolutions and Valneva yesterday said initial phase 1 clinical trial results for VLA1601, an inactivated alum-adjuvanted whole-virus vaccine against Zika virus, suggest it is safe and immunogenic.

In a press release, the companies said the first human trial of the vaccine was conducted in 67 healthy flavivirus-naive adults ages 18 to 49 in Knoxville, Tenn. Researchers tested two different doses given either 7 or 28 days apart. The interim safety and immunogenicity results include analyses up to 56 days after the first dose.

VLA1601 was immunogenic in all treatment groups and induced dose- and schedule-dependent neutralizing antibodies against Zika virus as expected for a vaccine of its type. Seroconversion rates reached up to 85.7% on day 35.

Wolfgang Bender, MD, PhD, chief medical officer at Valneva, said in the statement, ""The excellent safety profile supports further optimization of the elicited immune response to cover an unmet medical need in the most vulnerable populations.""

The companies said a final analysis covering up to day 208 after first vaccination is expected in the first quarter of 2019. VLA1601 is based on Valneva's manufacturing platform for an inactivated whole-virus vaccine against Japanese encephalitis. In July 2017 the France-based company and US-based Emergent BioSolutions announced a deal to codevelop the vaccine.

The outbreak totals now stand at 386 cases (339 confirmed, 47 probable), including 219 deaths. So far, 113 people have recovered from their infections, the health ministry said.

The new cases include 7 in Katwa, 2 in Beni, 2 in Kalunguta, and 1 each in Oicha and Mutwanga, all villages and cities in the DRC's North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

The outbreak, which began this summer, is the DRC's largest. It is on pace to surpass the world's second-largest Ebola outbreak ever, which occurred in 2000 in Uganda and amassed 425 cases and 224 deaths.

Last week, officials from the World Health Organization estimated the current outbreak could last at least another 6 months.

5 family members infected

Five of the new cases from Katwa were family members of a confirmed case-patient who died earlier this month. According the Ministry of Health, the family refused vaccination and follow-up before agreeing to be treated in a Butembo Ebola treatment center.

The single cases from Oicha and Mutwanga are related to cases from Beni, officials said.

In a positive note, the DRC said the small cluster of cases in Kanyihunga village, which is in a Mai-Mai controlled red zone, is under control.

""It has been six days since no case has been reported in this village. A total of 360 contacts were recorded in the village, of which 16 left the 21-day follow-up on Tuesday, November 20, and 172 will be out of follow-up on Friday, November 23,"" DRC health officials said. Other contacts will complete follow-up on Dec 5.

Vaccination efforts have now reached more than 33,000 people, the DRC said, with 16,395 of those vaccinated living in Beni.

Nov 21 DRC update",no result found,no result found,"DAKAR (Reuters) - Thirteen new cases of Ebola were confirmed on Wednesday in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo - one of the highest daily counts since the start of the outbreak in July, the health ministry said.

“It’s pretty exceptional,” health ministry spokeswoman Jessica Ilunga said, commenting on the data published in its daily bulletin on the epidemic.

Attacks by armed groups have hampered international efforts to control the outbreak, the worst in Congo’s history, which has infected over 380 people and killed two-thirds of them.

The number of new cases has accelerated in the past month and an emergency committee of World Health Organization experts said in October that the outbreak was likely to worsen significantly unless the response was stepped up.

Treatment, vaccination programmes and safe burials of victims have been disrupted by a surge in violence and abiding local mistrust of health directives.

22-Nov-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

Containing the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a complex and challenging task but WHO remains confident that the outbreak can be successfully contained in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and partners.

On 16 November 2018, an armed group attacked the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) base in the Boikene District, in the city of Beni, close to the UN Ebola response residences. Response operations in Beni were briefly paused but all activities, including vaccination, resumed by 18 November. WHO condemns the attacks on peacekeepers who are integral to the ongoing efforts to manage the EVD outbreak. WHO will continue to evaluate the situation and risks involved, and remain vigilant about measures to protect responders and civilians.

Health centres have been identified as a source of disease transmission. Medications administered via injections were a notable cause of infection. Current efforts are focused on improving infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, including providing water and products for cleaning, training health providers at informal health centres and encouraging the provisision of medications which do not require injections.

During the reporting period (14 – 20 November), 36 new confirmed EVD cases were reported from Beni, Mutwanga, Kalunguta, Butembo, Katwa and Oicha while seven probable cases were reported from Kalunguta. Seven of the new cases were newborn babies and infants aged less than two years, six were children aged between 2 – 17 years and one case was a pregnant woman. Five health workers from Beni and Katwa were among the newly infected; 39 health workers have been infected to date. Ten additional survivors were discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) in Beni (six) and Butembo (four) and reintegrated into their communities; 113 patients have recovered to date.

As of 20 November, 386 EVD cases (339 confirmed and 47 probable), including 219 deaths (172 confirmed and 47 probable)1, have been reported in 11 health zones in North Kivu Province and three health zones in Ituri Province (Figure 1). The overall trends in weekly case incidence reflect continued community transmission in several cities and villages in North Kivu (Figure 2). Given the expected delays in case detection and ongoing data reconciliation activities, trends, especially in the most recent weeks, must be interpreted cautiously.

The risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains very high. Over the course of the past week, alerts have been reported from Uganda and Zambia; EVD has been ruled out for all alerts to date.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries.

For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, see the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country, which border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO’s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

LONDON — The World Health Organization says a worrying number of the newest Ebola cases amid Congo’s ongoing outbreak are in patients not usually known to catch the disease: babies.

In an update published this week, the U.N. health agency reported 36 new confirmed cases of Ebola, including seven in newborn babies and infants younger than 2 years old. Six cases were reported in children aged between 2 and 17 and one case was in a pregnant woman.

While Ebola typically infects adults, as they are most likely to be exposed to the lethal virus, children have been known in some instances to catch the disease when they act as caregivers.

Few cases of Ebola in babies have been reported, but experts suspect transmission might happen via breast milk or close contact with infected parents. Ebola is typically spread by infected bodily fluids. WHO noted that health centers have been identified as a source of Ebola transmission, with injections of medications “a notable cause.”

WHO called Congo’s current epidemic “complex and challenging.” Congo’s health ministry says there are 346 confirmed cases, including 175 deaths, in what has become the worst Ebola outbreak in the country’s recorded history.

The outbreak has been plagued by security problems, with health workers attacked by rebels in districts where the virus has been spreading. Earlier this month, Ebola containment operations were paused after seven U.N. peacekeepers and 12 Congolese soldiers were killed, but all activities have resumed.

The increasing number of cases in children and health workers — 39 health workers have been infected to date — suggests outbreak responders are having major problems stopping the virus in health clinics and convincing people to seek help when they develop symptoms. This is the first time this part of Congo has faced an Ebola outbreak.

WHO said the risk of the outbreak spreading to neighboring countries remains “very high” but it does not recommend travel restrictions. Uganda this month started vaccinating health workers against Ebola in a heavily traveled border district near the outbreak."

Recent figures say 151 patients received one of the four drugs. Of those, 76 recovered, 44 died and 31 are still hospitalised - a mortality rate of 37 percent.

In contrast, among those who had not received treatment, the mortality rate was close to 80 percent.

Despite the use of the treatments, as well as an experimental vaccine manufactured by Merck, authorities have struggled to contain the outbreak in the country's east amid widespread militia violence and community resistance to health workers.

Earlier this month, Ebola containment operations were briefly paused after seven United Nations peacekeepers and 12 DRC soldiers were killed.

Newborns infected

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the disease has also been infecting babies, a population group not usually known to catch Ebola.

In an update published this week, WHO reported 36 new confirmed cases of Ebola, including seven in newborn babies and infants younger than two. Six cases were reported in children aged between two and 17; one case was in a pregnant woman.

While Ebola typically infects adults, as they are most likely to be exposed to the lethal virus, children have been known in some instances to catch the disease when they act as caregivers.

Few cases of Ebola in babies have been reported, but experts suspect transmission might happen via breast milk or close contact with infected parents.

Ebola is typically spread by infected bodily fluids. WHO cited health centres as a source of Ebola transmission, calling the current epidemic ""complex and challenging"".

At least 228 people are believed to have died, with the WHO saying last week that it expects the outbreak to last at least another six months.

The increasing number of cases in children and health workers - 39 health workers have been infected to date - suggests outbreak responders are having major problems stopping the virus.

WHO said the risk of the outbreak spreading to neighbouring countries remains ""very high"" but it does not recommend travel restrictions.

Uganda, this month, started vaccinating health workers against Ebola in a heavily-travelled border district near the outbreak.",no result found,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congolese authorities have authorized clinical trials for four experimental Ebola treatments, which will allow researchers to collect valuable data about their effectiveness, the health ministry said on Saturday.

Health workers have already administered therapeutic treatments to more than 150 Ebola patients since August in an effort to contain the worst of Democratic Republic of Congo’s 10 outbreaks of the hemorrhagic fever since 1976.

But until now doctors have decided which treatment to use on a case-by-case basis. In the clinical trial, the choice of treatment will now be randomized.

Treatment will still be free of charge, the ministry added in a statement.

“Precious information about the effectiveness of the treatments obtained during the clinical trial will allow for the development of these treatments on a wider scale to save more lives,” the ministry said.

The four treatments are mAb114, which was developed by the U.S. government; ZMapp, an intravenous treatment made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical; Remdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences; and Regeneron’s REGN-EB3.

As of last weekend, 151 patients had received one of the four drugs. Of those, 76 had recovered, 44 had died and 31 were still hospitalized — a mortality rate of 37 percent.

By contrast, among those who had not received treatment, the mortality rate was close to 80 percent.

The ministry said that the data from the current outbreak would probably not be sufficient to make definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of the treatments and that the trials could continue during future outbreaks.

Despite the use of the treatments as well as an experimental vaccine manufactured by Merck, authorities have struggled to contain the outbreak due to widespread militia violence in eastern Congo and community resistance to health workers.

Meanwhile, in its latest weekly update on the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) said transmission continues in several North Kivu province cities and villages. Currently, the three main hot spots are Kalunguta, located in a security ""red zone,"" Beni, and the Butembo/Katwa area.

The WHO said the Ebola situation in the DRC remains complex and challenging, but it is still confident that the DRC and its partners can successfully contain the outbreak.

Health center exposures, infections in babies

In its update, the WHO said health centers have been identified as a source of disease transmission and that medications given as injections are a notable cause of disease spread. The agency added that efforts are under way to improve infection prevention and control, provide water and products for cleaning, training health providers, and encouraging treatment with medications that don't require injections.

Spread of the virus in health facilities that aren't Ebola treatment centers has occurred in earlier outbreaks, and infections among healthcare workers are known to amplify outbreaks. A recent report noted a spurt of new infections in healthcare workers, and the WHO's latest reports say 39 have been infected so far, at least 10 of them fatally.

Of 36 cases confirmed from Nov 14 to Nov 20, 7 involved newborn babies and 6 were in children ages 2 to 17. One of the illnesses was in a pregnant woman. The high numbers of illnesses in children and in women has been an unusual feature of the DRC's outbreak. According to the latest numbers, 61% of confirmed and probable case-patients have been female.

33 new cases, 21 more deaths

In daily updates spanning Nov 22 through Nov 25, the DRC's health ministry reported 33 more Ebola cases, lifting the total to 419 illnesses, including 372 confirmed and 47 probable cases.

The latest cases were reported in Beni (12), Katwa (9), Kalunguta (5), Butembo (6), and Oicha (1). At this rate, the epidemic will soon surpass the world's second-largest Ebola outbreak ever, which occurred in Uganda in 2000 and involved 425 cases.

In its update today, the health ministry said officials are investigating 59 suspected Ebola cases. Since Nov 21, the ministry reported 21 more deaths, raising the outbreak's fatality count to 240.

In its Nov 23 update, the health ministry said that, because of an increase in cases in Butembo and surrounding areas, outbreak coordinators decided to send additional response teams to the areas of Katwa, Kaluguta, and Lubero. The team sent to Lubero will be tasked with strengthening epidemiologic surveillance and training health workers on how to identify and treat suspected cases and high-risk contacts from Butembo.

The ministry said today that 35,958 people have now been vaccinated. At least 10,110 are frontline health workers.

Treatment trial launch

In another new outbreak development, the health ministry said in a Nov 24 announcement that an ethics committee at the University of Kinshasa has approved a protocol for testing four experimental Ebola treatments, which are currently being used on an emergency basis in Ebola treatment centers. They are mAb114, Zmapp, remdesivir, and Regeneron's REGN-EB3 antibody.

The authorization for emergency or compassionate use, however, doesn't provide for the standardized collection of data on the efficacy and safety of each treatment the health ministry said.

The ministry statement indicates that the clinical trial started last week on three of the four treatments (Zmapp, mAb114, and remdesivir) at Beni's Ebola treatment center. Future trials could be extended to other sites and include REGN-EB3. However, for now, the other Ebola treatment centers will continue to administer the drugs on a compassionate basis.

As with compassionate use treatment, patients or families will need to give informed consent to participate in clinical trials, but the main difference will be that the choice of treatment will be randomized by lottery rather than selected by doctors.

The number of patients in the trial will depend on how the outbreak evolves and how willing patients are to participate, the ministry said. It added that data in the North Kivu outbreak alone aren't likely to be enough to draw firm conclusions about the treatments, and the clinical trials may extend over 5 years and cover several outbreaks in multiple affected countries.

160 have received experimental treatment

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said in a WHO statement today, ""While our focus remains on bringing this outbreak to an end, the launch of the randomized control trial in DRC is an important step towards finally finding an Ebola treatment that will save lives.""

The WHO said 160 patients in the DRC have already been treated with experimental drugs as part of the emergency use protocol.

The randomized clinical trial protocol is part of a multi-outbreak, multi-country study agreed to in a meeting of experts, partners, and other stakeholders convened by the WHO in October. That meeting resulted in a research and development blueprint for Ebola treatment clinical trials, which is published in a 14-page document on the WHO's website.

In its statement, the WHO said it is coordinating the trial, which is led and sponsored by the DRC's National Institute for Biomedical Research with its partners at the country's health ministry, the US National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Alliance for International Medical Action, and other groups.

Today the ministry of health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reported two more Ebola cases in the ongoing outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. The outbreak total now stands at 421 cases (374 confirmed and 47 probable), including 241 deaths.

The two new cases are from Kyondo and Kalunguta, and one additional death was recorded in Beni. Seventy-four cases are still under investigation.

CDC confirms 10 new acute flaccid myelitis cases, 116 total

In an update yesterday on the ongoing accuse flaccid myelitis (AFM) outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 10 more cases, raising the outbreak total to 116 confirmed cases in 31 states.

The 116 confirmed cases are part of 286 reports CDC has received of patients under investigation in 2018. Colorado has reported the most confirmed cases, with 15, followed by Texas (14).

There is still no consensus on the cause of AFM. Though some cases have been linked to enteroviruses, the CDC said that virus is common in children and most often does not lead to AFM.

AFM is a rare, polio-like illness that affects the nervous system and causes muscles and limbs to weaken. Since 2014, the CDC has tracked AFM, which seems to operate on a cyclical seasonal schedule, with most outbreaks occurring every 2 years in the early fall.

In 2016, there were 149 confirmed cases of AFM in 39 states and Washington, D.C., the most of any year.

New polio vaccine candidate requires no refrigeration

Scientists from the University of Southern California (USC) have developed a freeze-dried polio vaccine that could one day prove a useful tool in the endgame of the virus.

The thermostable lyophilized Sabin inactivated poliovirus vaccine (sIPV) is an injected vaccine that can be stored without refrigeration and reconstituted at the time of use. According to a study in mBio, the vaccine performed well in mice.

""The feasibility of the use of current IPV formulations in developing countries is limited, because IPV is insufficiently stable to be purified, transported, and stored under unrefrigerated conditions,"" the authors wrote. ""We successfully designed the sIPV for use in the dry state that maintains the full vaccine potency in animal models after incubation at ambient temperature.""

In the study, the freeze-dried sIPV was kept at 37°C (98.6°F) for 4 weeks before being reconstituted and injected into mice, where it induced an antipoliovirus immune response.

A temperature-stable vaccine could be useful in countries where refrigeration is unreliable. In recent weeks, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Papua New Guinea have all reported new polio cases.

Nov 27 mBio study

Report urges vigilance for Zika spread from India's outbreak hot spot

India is currently experiencing its largest Zika virus outbreak, with most cases reported from the Rajasthan state capital of Jaipur, and Indian cities and countries with close connections to the city should prepare for possible imported cases, a Canadian-led research team recently reported in a letter to the Journal of Travel Medicine.

By the end of October, 147 cases had been reported in Jaipur, a popular tourist destination, and as of Nov 2, neighboring Gujarat state reported 1 case and Madhya Pradesh state reported 3 infections.

To look at potential spread of the virus, the group analyzed the timing and volume of airline connections to Jaipur, along with the environmental suitability of populations of mosquitoes that can carry the virus in destinations cities within and outside of India. Based on airline data from November 2016 through January 2017, the investigators found there were 326 cities near areas that can support Zika transmission. Of passengers traveling out of Rajasthan, 94% traveled to Indian cities, mostly Mumbai, New Delhi, Bengaluru, and Kolkata. International cities in the top 20 destinations included Bangkok, Muscat, and Singapore.

The authors concluded that because there are so many regions that can support Zika transmission that have large populations with limited exposure and immunity to the virus, Indian cities and international locations with close travel ties to Jaipur should prepare for possible cases in upcoming months. They added that the risk of domestic spread is greater, especially in the city of Chennai, with its close ties to the outbreak hot spot, large population, and environment that could support year-round transmission by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.

Nov 22 J Travel Med abstract","It is the worst Ebola outbreak to have struck the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) - and the most complex one.

Since August, authorities in the country, together with a host of partners, have been trying to contain a new outbreak of the disease in the eastern North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

As of November 21, there have been 373 suspected cases of Ebola, including 347 confirmed cases. At least 217 people have already died.

There have been 10 outbreaks of Ebola since 1976 in the DRC, which is considered among the most experienced in dealing with the virus.

The situation this time, though, is different.

The North Kivu and Ituri provinces are among the most unstable and densely populated in the country, and subject to some of the highest levels of human mobility in it.

At the same time, there are warnings that a ""perfect storm"" of insecurity, community resistance about vaccinations and political manipulation threatens the efforts to contain the spread of the virus.

These factors collectively make the latest outbreak unlike anything the DRC, which is scheduled to hold a crucial presidential election on December 23, has experienced before.

What is Ebola and how does it spread?

The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of infected animals. These include, but are not limited to, monkeys or fruit bats.

The virus is known to cause high fever, vomiting and diarrhoea, as well as internal and external bleeding; it puts the body into a state of shock and results in a decrease of the perfusion of blood to vital organs, ultimately inducing multi-system organ failure.

Once infected, patients have a very low chance of surviving.

When did the latest outbreak in the DRC begin?

In late July 2018, the provincial government of North Kivu reported 26 cases of acute haemorrhagic fever that had resulted in 20 deaths.

{articleGUID}

Six specimens of blood were sent to the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) in the capital, Kinshasa, where four samples tested positive for the Ebola virus.

""The result of the genetic analysis by INRB confirmed Ebola Zaire strain, but not linked to the Equateur outbreak strain, meaning that we are dealing with a new outbreak,"" Lianne Gutcher, a communications officer with the World Health Organization (WHO), told Al Jazeera.

The country's Ministry of Health officially declared an outbreak on August 1, 2018.

The centre of the outbreak is now Beni in North Kivu, though the medical charity Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French initials MSF, has warned that there is a possibility it could move to Butembo, a town close to neighbouring Uganda.

How does this outbreak compare with previous ones in the DRC?

Ebola is considered endemic in the DRC, with the first cases in 1976 appearing simultaneously in Yambuku - in the north of the country near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name - and Nzara, in what is now South Sudan.

While there is still no cure, the introduction of a vaccination programme earlier this year has been touted as the next step towards a more effective management of future outbreaks.

The DRC has been hit by two outbreaks this year.

The first one was declared in May after the deaths of 29 people in the city of Mbandaka in the Equateur province. Though there were concerns the town's proximity to the Congo River would see the virus moving to Kinshasa, the timely implementation of a vaccination drive saw the virus quickly contained.

That outbreak was announced over on July 24.

Both Uganda and the DRC have been able to prevent mammoth epidemics spreading as it did in West Africa between 2014 and 2016 that infected 28,000 people and caused 11,300 deaths. But given that the current outbreak in North Kivu is perhaps the first time the virus has spread into an area already home to a large-scale humanitarian crisis, containing the spread of Ebola this time around is proving to be a lot more difficult.

It is already the largest outbreak in the DRC and is on course to become the second largest Ebola outbreak ever.

""The difference is that we are now operating in a war zone,"" Axelle Ronsse, the emergency coordinator for MSF's Ebola response, told Al Jazeera, referring to the militia violence that has long plagued parts of the country's east.

How has the security crisis impacted efforts to contain the virus?

North Kivu is home to a number of armed groups, including the Allied Defence Forces (ADF), a Ugandan rebel group, that has operated with impunity since 1995.

The endless upheavals in the region have meant regular dispossession and the incessant movement of refugees to neighbouring countries or within the province itself. As it stands, there are more than a million internally displaced people in North Kivu.

""The violence impacts our work on a daily basis,"" Ronsse says. ""We are not targeted but it is a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.""

Likewise, Gutcher, from the WHO, says that some attacks have resulted in medical activities being severely impeded or temporarily shut down.

""Community violence has also at times impeded the work of safe burial teams' ability to conduct safe and dignified burials.""

{articleGUID}

In October, rebels killed 13 civilians and kidnapped a dozen children in an assault on Beni.

In November, seven Malawian and one Tanzanian peacekeeper were killed in another attack on the town.

The instability has also made it difficult for health professionals to locate others who might have been in contact with suspected victims, in what is known as ""contact tracing"", considered a basic pillar of any effort to contain Ebola.

Last month, The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) wrote that ""carrying out the effective contact tracing and community engagement can permit rapid identification of people who are ill and facilitate the provision of early clinical care, which has been shown to improve the likelihood of survival.""

Jessica Ilunga, communications officer for the DRC's Ministry of Public Health, told Al Jazeera that every security-related incident affected field activities. She added that the underlying security context had also created a climate in which health workers faced an unprecedented level of community resistance.

""The predominance of traditional healers, who are more trusted by the population than modern medicine, has also led to an important number of nosocomial transmissions of the virus,"" Ilunga said.

{articleGUID}

Citing the instability in the eastern DRC, the WHO elevated the national crisis to ""very high"" in late September. The crisis is still not considered a public health emergency of international concern and the world health body does not recommend imposing any trade or travel restrictions with the DRC.

How have the DRC and the international community responded to this crisis?

Since the introduction of the vaccination programme by the DRC's government and the WHO, a key intervention has involved vaccinating suspected patients and then administering a second ""ring"" to those who might have come into contact with these suspected cases.

The vaccine is Canadian-developed but licensed and produced by the American pharmaceutical company Merck.

According to the WHO, around 300 medical specialists have been deployed to the country to support the response plan. Around 32,500 people-at-risk have been vaccinated, including 10,600 health workers and 8,600 children.

On November 24, the government and the WHO said they would be conducting clinical trials to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs used on Ebola patients to find the most effective treatment for the virus.

Authorities have already started using the drugs on a case-by-case basis on around 151 people. Those who used the drugs had a 63 percent chance of survival, while those who did not receive medication had a fatality rate close to 80 percent.

""Now that protocols for trials are in place, patients will be offered treatments under that framework in the facilities where the trial has started,"" the WHO said.

{articleGUID}

Over and above vaccinations and drugs, efforts have been made to spread information through door-to-door advocacy, with more than 2,500 homes visited, including almost 1,400 homes in Beni alone.

""Faced with rumours and misinformation, some families have chosen to care for sick relatives at home; some patients leave healthcare centres to find alternatives or actively avoid follow up,"" Gutcher says.

Authorities have also trained around 1,700 volunteers to assist with community-based efforts. Across the border in Uganda, 758 health workers in 19 health facilities have been vaccinated.

In mid-November, the WHO said that the outbreak would end in mid-2019.

But Ilunga, from the DRC's Ministry of Public Health, says her government is hopeful that the efforts to contain the outbreak would succeed sooner than the WHO's target, but concedes that ""the success of this response also depends on a number of factors that we do not control, such as security"".

Why do outbreaks continue to occur in the DRC?

Microbiologists argue that viruses such as Ebola often occur among animal populations faced with restricted movement.

However, health professionals are concerned that should the Ebola become endemic to the troubled areas in the northeastern DRC, it would mean ""a sustained and unpredictable spread of the deadly virus, with major implications for travel and trade"".

""This will mean that we've lost the ability to trace contacts, stop transmission chains and contain the outbreak,"" Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said in a briefing earlier in November.

For her part, Ilunga says the country needs to accept the fact that the disease ""will resurface regularly"" and ""make preventive and curative treatments more available and improve the population's knowledge about the virus"".",no result found,no result found,no result found
28-Nov-18,no result found,Up to 50 of the suspected cases entering the Ebola treatment center actually have malaria. This is sexually explicit. HttpstcohjBfgcIDxC,Ebola 1 case 1 death reported today bringing the North Kivu outbreak totals to 422 cases amp 242 deaths There httpstcoEc57Jb29uR,"A surge in malaria infections—with symptoms that can mimic Ebola—in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) main Ebola hot spot prompted the launch today of a 4-day mass malaria drug administration campaign, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced.

Meanwhile, the DRC's health ministry today reported 1 more illness, raising the overall total to 422 cases.

Malaria campaign to reach 450,000

The malaria efforts are designed not only to treat widespread malaria illnesses and deaths, it is also geared toward relieving pressure on the medical clinics, given that 50% of people screened in Ebola treatment centers have been found to have malaria instead of Ebola, the WHO said.

The campaign is similar to one launched in Sierra Leone during its outbreak in 2014 and is led by the DRC's malaria control program with support from the WHO, UNICEF, the Global Fund, and the US President's Malaria Initiative.

The WHO said the malaria-control campaign has two parts: distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets and mass antimalarial drug administration, with a goal of reaching 450,000 people.

Mass drug administration will treat people who already contracted the disease and curb transmission among Ebola-hit populations and health centers.

Globally, the DRC has the second most malaria cases each year, right behind Nigeria. North Kivu province, where hard-hit Ebola communities are located, has experienced up to an eightfold increase—about 2,000 cases per week—in malaria as of early September compared with the same period in 2017.

Latest case, death are in Beni

The newly reported case today involves a patient from Beni, the outbreak's epicenter. Also, one more death from the virus was reported from the city. The latest developments push the overall total to 422 Ebola cases, including 375 confirmed and 47 probable, plus 242 deaths.

If cases in the DRC top 425, the outbreak will become the world's second largest, topping one that struck Uganda in 2000. Only the massive 2014-2016 West Africa outbreak is larger.

In its update today, the health ministry said 74 suspected Ebola cases are still under investigation and 37,075 people have been vaccinated against the disease, roughly half of them in Beni.

Also, officials said comedians from Beni took part in a community sensitization activity to explain the proper use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and malaria medications.

Nov 28 WHO statement on malaria-control campaign

Nov 28 DRC update",no result found,no result found,"DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Health workers on Wednesday launched a door-to-door, four-day blitz to control malaria in Democratic Republic of Congo with the aim of cutting suspected Ebola cases in half.

“It will make things a lot easier if malaria is taken out of the equation,” Stefan Hoyer of the World Health Organization said by phone from Beni, epicenter of the Ebola outbreak.

The town of Beni in North Kivu province, currently battling the worst Ebola outbreak in Congo’s history, has also seen an eight-fold increase in malaria cases since last year.

Children who went to health centers for malaria are believed to have contracted Ebola there, and about half of the people screened in Ebola centers only had malaria, said the WHO. If malaria is reduced, health workers will be able to focus on real Ebola patients and keep others away from the wards.

Ebola has killed 240 people and infected more than 400 since July in an outbreak that shows little sign of abating.

It is spread through contact with bodily fluids and symptoms include vomiting, bleeding and diarrhoea.

The world’s worst outbreak - from 2014 to 2016 - killed more than 11,000 people in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Congo is the second worst country in the world for malaria, trailing only Nigeria, and Hoyer said there were no more mosquito-blocking bed nets left in North Kivu, an eastern province that is battling both conflict and disease.

Malaria can normally be diagnosed with a rapid blood test, but the risk of Ebola transmission means health workers have to rely on an assessment of symptoms, he said.

This normally results in an over-reported number of cases - but not up to eight-fold, which is 2,000 cases a week, he said.

Starting on Wednesday, health workers planned to go door-to-door for four days in the town of Beni, delivering mosquito nets and anti-malarial drugs to 450,000 people, said the WHO.

The aim - to treat people who already have malaria and prevent transmission among others in the short-term, freeing up resources to focus on the more serious disease, it said.

“We can assume that the suspected Ebola cases to be triaged would at least go down by half,” Hoyer told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

This is what happened in Sierra Leone’s capital, Freetown, when people with malaria were filling Ebola treatment centers during the West African outbreak in 2014, he said.

The current malaria control campaign is modeled on the one implemented in Sierra Leone, said the WHO.",no result found
29-Nov-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

As the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak approaches five months since declaration, responding to the outbreak continues to be a challenge; nevertheless, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and partners, WHO remains focused on the ongoing containment efforts to end the outbreak. The MoH, WHO and partners are intensively focusing response activities in areas where EVD transmission continues, including Butembo, Katwa, Beni and Kalunguta.

During the reporting period (21—27 November 2018), 36 new cases were reported: 13 in Beni, nine in Katwa, six in Kalungunta, six in Butembo, one in Kyondo and one in Oicha. Two health workers from Katwa and Kyondo were among the newly infected; 42 health workers have been infected to date. Twelve additional survivors were discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) in Beni (six) and Butembo (six), and reintegrated into their communities; 125 patients have recovered to date.

For the past two months, WHO has been responding to the developing situation in Katwa, Butembo, Beni and Kalungunta. Preliminary data indicate an impact of the public health control measures in Beni and Kalunguta. Community engagement remains a challenge in Katwa. Despite substantial progress, the high proportion of cases who were not previously registered as contacts and therefore not followed-up by the surveillance teams, needs to be improved. Concerns have been raised regarding the high number of young children affected (aged one year or less). In total, 36 cases have been reported among newborn babies and children aged less than two years and 17 cases among pregnant women have been reported since the beginning of the outbreak.

As of 27 November, 422 EVD cases (375 confirmed and 47 probable)1, including 242 deaths, have been reported in 11 health zones in North Kivu Province and three health zones in Ituri Province (Figure 1). Given the expected delays in case detection and reporting, overall trends in weekly case incidence must be interpreted cautiously, in the most recent weeks (Figure 2).

The risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains very high. Over the course of the past week, alerts have been reported from South Sudan and Uganda; EVD has been ruled out for all alerts to date.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, Infection Prevention Control (IPC), clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. Currently, 300 WHO specialists are deployed to the DRC to support the ongoing response.

For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country, which border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO’s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Of the 426 cases, 379 are confirmed and 47 are probable. A total of 245 people have died from the virus, and 87 suspected cases remain under investigation, according to the daily update from try DRC health ministry. Of the four new cases recorded today, three are in Katwa and one is in Vuhovi.

Surpassing an outbreak of 425 cases in Uganda in 2000, the current outbreak is now second only in case counts to West Africa's massive 2014-2016 outbreak, which involved more than 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths.

Powder keg situation

The 426 case milestone highlights the powder keg of factors that have made this outbreak persist in spite of the widespread use of an Ebola vaccine that was not available until the tail end of the West Africa outbreak. Difficulties have included violence against health workers and community resistance.

In a situation report published yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said two more health workers have been infected during this outbreak, raising the total number of infected healthcare workers to 41, including 12 deaths.

The virus is still being transmitted in four villages—Butembo, Katwa, Beni and Kalunguta—and 36 new cases were reported in the last week (Nov 21 through 27).

The WHO also noted in an outbreak notice today that 36 cases of Ebola have occurred in children under the age of 2 years, and 17 cases have involved pregnant women. In Katwa, contact follow-up has been challenging, and a high proportion of cases were previously unregistered case contacts.

No cases in Uganda

Yesterday the WHO issued a joint statement with the Ministry of Health in Uganda denying media reports that Uganda had its first Ebola case. The alleged case-patient was monitored in Kabarole District, Uganda, and blood samples have tested negative for Ebola and other hemorrhagic fever viruses.

Efforts to protect Ugandans from the virus are still under way.

""A total of 1,316 front line and healthcare workers in three (3) districts have been vaccinated against EVD [Ebola virus disease] to protect this cadre of people against the deadly disease,"" the statement said. ""The Ministry of Health together with the WHO country office wish to reiterate that there is no confirmed case of Ebola Virus Disease in Uganda, and are working tirelessly to keep the country safe from the deadly disease.""

Inadequate infection prevention, control

In its situation report, the WHO called the outbreak ""unpredictable"" and said there have been multiple security incidents at entry points in Beni and Butembo in the last week. Efforts to educate communities about safe and dignified burial (SDB) practices and the screening of education films on Ebola are under way in the region.

""A community burial approach to mitigate the risk of transmission from unsafe burials in areas non-accessible by SDB teams is being piloted in three health areas of the Kalunguta Health Zone with close cooperation with the respective communities,"" the WHO said.

More than 22,000 case contacts have been registered since the onset of the outbreak, and as of earlier this week, 4,767 were still under follow-up. Beni still has the most contacts lost to follow-up. A total of 37,559 contacts have been vaccinated against the virus.

""The security situation in North Kivu and Ituri continues to hinder the implementation of response activities,"" the WHO said. The organization has 300 workers in the region.

Experts call for US involvement

In an editorial today in JAMA Network Open, Lawrence O. Gostin, JD, of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law and Georgetown University Law Center, and colleagues said the United States needs to deepen its engagement in outbreak response.

""The US, along with allies and the UN, should develop a plan to deploy public health personnel to North Kivu. It is in US national interests to control outbreaks before they escalate into a crisis. The cost of addressing this epidemic now is far less than if mass mobilization were required due to international spread of the virus,"" Gostin and two other experts said.

Earlier this fall, US personnel were pulled from North Kivu in response to local violence, a move criticized at the time by Robert Redfield, MD, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Jennifer Nuzzo, DrPH, and Thomas Inglesby, MD, echoed Gostin's arguments in an opinion piece published yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine.

""Though there are risks in sending additional personnel to the DRC, high risks would also be posed by an outbreak spiraling out of control,"" the write. ""We therefore believe that the U.S. government should allow CDC staff to return to the field for as long as the WHO and others deem necessary.""

Nuzzo and Inglesby are with the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

Nov 28 N Engl J of Med perspective",no result found,no result found,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - The Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo is now the second biggest in history, with 426 confirmed and probable cases, the health ministry said late on Thursday.

The epidemic in a volatile part of Democratic Republic of Congo is now only surpassed by the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa, where more than 28,000 cases where confirmed, and is bigger than an outbreak in 2000 in Uganda involving 425 cases.

Ebola is believed to have killed 245 people in North Kivu and Ituri provinces where attacks by armed groups and community resistance to health officials have hampered the response.

Congo has suffered 10 Ebola outbreaks since the virus was discovered there in 1976. It spreads through contact with bodily fluids and causes hemorrhagic fever with severe vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding, and in many flare-ups, more than half of cases are fatal.

“This tragic milestone clearly demonstrates the complexity and severity of the outbreak,” Michelle Gayer, Senior Director of Emergency Health at the International Rescue Committee said in a statement. “The dynamics of conflict (mean) ... a protracted outbreak is ... likely, and the end is not in sight.”",no result found

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) health ministry today reported two more Ebola cases, plus two more deaths, according to its daily statement.

Of the two new cases, one is a lab confirmed infection in a patient from Beni. The other is classified as a probable illness involving an individual from Katwa, located east of Butembo, who died and is part of a family cluster from the area that the ministry reported on Nov 20.

The two additional deaths both involve people from Beni.

Today's developments boost the overall outbreak total to 428, which includes 380 confirmed and 48 probable cases. The latest deaths lift the fatality total to 248. Meanwhile, health officials are still investigating 66 suspected Ebola cases, according to today's report.

In vaccination developments, the total number immunized with VSV-EBOV since the ring vaccination campaign began on Aug 8 is 38,018.

Nov 30 DRC update

In research developments, an analysis of Ebola transmission linked to virus persistence in survivors after the West Africa outbreak identified 13 possible events, with 8 recipients identified and a possible source found for 5. An international research team reported their findings today in Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Of the 8 recipients found, 7 were female, and the group ranged in age from 16 to 55 years.

Researchers couldn't identify a clear hypothesis for transmission in four events. Five met the criteria for sexual transmission, and all of the survivors linked to the cases were male. Transmission through breast milk may have occurred in one of the events. One of the transmission events led to at least four generations of cases, the group reported.

""Our findings are relevant for response planning, especially related to surveillance and response capacity, and for the development of policies and guidelines regarding survivor counselling, care, and management,"" they wrote.

Low-path H5N2 detected in Minnesota turkeys; H5N8 strikes South Africa

In the latest avian influenza outbreak developments, Minnesota detected low-pathogenic H5N2 again at another turkey farm, and South Africa recently reported a highly pathogenic H5N8 outbreak at a commercial ostrich farm, according to notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).

In Minnesota, enhanced surveillance for avian flu viruses has found low pathogenic H5N2 at commercial turkey farms in two counties since the middle of November. The virus is related to a North American wild bird low-pathogenic H5N2 lineage.

The latest detection occurred on Nov 13 at a facility housing 40,000 birds in the already-affected Kandiyohi County in the central part of the state. The birds will be depopulated through controlled marketing.

Meanwhile, South Africa's agriculture ministry reported another highly pathogenic H5N8 outbreak at a commercial ostrich farm, part of a sporadic cluster of outbreaks involving that strain. The latest outbreak began on Oct 29 at a farm in Western Cape province in the south of the country. The virus killed 20 of 461 birds, and the surviving birds were slated for culling. South Africa reported its last H5N8 outbreak during the first week of November.

US ILI rate rose above national average during Thanksgiving week

The percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) now stands at 2.3%, which is above the national baseline of 2.2%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) FluView report for the week ending Nov 24.

Five of the 10 US regions reported ILI at or above their baseline levels, with 2 states (Georgia and Louisiana) reporting high ILI activity; Alabama, Oklahoma, and Utah reported moderate activity; New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and 8 states experiencing low activity; and 37 states reporting minimal activity.

The rise in ILI echoes past seasons which saw a slight uptick around Thanksgiving, the CDC said, adding that the pattern may reflect fewer clinic visits for routine health issues.

Both influenza A and B are circulating, but 2009 H1N1 remains the dominant strain, representing 83.3% of influenza A viruses subtyped. Influenza A was found in 95.5% of public health lab samples, compared to 4.5% of samples showing influenza B.

Two pediatric deaths attributed to flu were reported to CDC this week, raising the 2018-2019 season total to five.

Nov 30 CDC FluView","The Democratic Republic of Congo's deadly Ebola outbreak is now the second largest in history, behind the devastating West Africa outbreak that killed thousands a few years ago, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Dr Peter Salama, WHO's emergencies chief, called it a ""sad toll"" as DR Congo's health ministry announced the number of cases has reached 426.

That includes 379 confirmed cases and 47 probable ones.

So far this outbreak, declared on August 1, has caused 198 confirmed deaths, DR Congo's health ministry said.

The latest outbreak is the tenth in DR Congo since Ebola was first detected there in 1976.

The crisis is centred around the restive eastern city of Beni in North Kivu, a region which has been blighted by armed conflict, which has hampered efforts to curb the outbreak.

Attacks by rebel groups and open hostility by some wary locals have posed serious challenges to health workers that Ebola experts say they have never seen before.

Many venture out on critical virus containment missions only accompanied by UN peacekeepers in areas where gunfire echoes daily.

Peter Jay Hotez, from Baylor College of Medicine, told Al Jazeera the violence has contributed to the collapse of the healthcare infrastructure, so efforts by health workers are seriously hampered.

""The good is we have a vaccine now. But the problem is, working in such an unstable area, you have to assure to safety of the vaccinators, and you have to be able to trace potential contacts, and get them vaccinated.""

Salama of WHO predicted that the outbreak in the northeastern part of the country will last at least another six months before it can be contained.

West Africa's Ebola outbreak killed more than 11,000 people from 2014 to 2016.

'Red zones'

More than 37,000 people have received Ebola vaccinations, and DR Congo has begun the first-ever trial to test the effectiveness and safety of four experimental Ebola drugs.

Yet, the risk of Ebola spreading in so-called ""red zones"" - areas that are virtually inaccessible because of the threat of rebel groups - is a major concern in containing this outbreak.

""This tragic milestone clearly demonstrates the complexity and severity of the outbreak. While the numbers are far from those from West Africa in 2014, we're witnessing how the dynamics of conflict pose a different kind of threat,"" said Michelle Gayer, senior director of emergency health at the International Rescue Committee.

In a major concern for health workers, many new cases have been unconnected to known infections as the insecurity complicates efforts to track contacts of those with the disease.

The alarmingly high number of infected newborns in this outbreak is another concern, and so far a mystery.

In a separate statement on Thursday, WHO said so far 36 Ebola cases have been reported among newborn babies and children under 2.

As the need for help in containing the outbreak grows, two of the world's most prominent medical journals this week published statements by global health experts urging the Trump administration to do more.

In the Journal of the American Medical Association, one group noted that the US government weeks ago ordered all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel - ""some of the world's most experienced outbreak experts"" - from DR Congo's outbreak zone because of security concerns.

A separate statement published in the New England Journal of Medicine said: ""Given the worsening of the outbreak, we believe it's essential that these security concerns be addressed and that CDC staff return to the field.""

Ebola is a serious infectious disease that can spread rapidly through small amounts of bodily fluid, causing internal bleeding and potentially death.

DR Congo is in the throes of a major campaign ahead of a December 23 election to choose a successor to President Joseph Kabila, who has ruled the vast central African country since 2001.

Since winning independence from Belgium in 1960, this poverty-stricken nation has never known a peaceful transition of power.","The Democratic Republic of Congo is currently fighting its worst ever Ebola epidemic, concentrated to its restive North Kivu region. But armed militia groups are making access for WHO specialists and local health workers difficult. The crisis could therefore deteriorate quickly. FRANCE 24’s Bastien Renouil reports from a country that is fighting a war on several fronts.

ADVERTISING

By the end of November, DR Congo had recorded more than 400 cases of Ebola, including over 240 deaths. It’s the highest number of victims to have been reported since the virus was first discovered in the north of the country in 1976. Ever since the latest epidemic was confirmed on August 1, the WHO, the Congolese health ministry and international NGOs have set up special teams to respond to the crisis, and many of them have been deployed to the North Kivu city of Béni, which is at the epicentre of the epidemic. But the response has proved particularly difficult in this region, where armed militias sow terror on a daily basis, preventing medical teams from reaching some affected areas.

Militants belonging to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) jihadist group come out at night and conduct deadly raids on both Béni and its surrounding villages. Many residents have either been killed or abducted. The Congolese army has been unable to stop the killings on its own, resulting in MONUSCO (the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) launching an operation to try to protect civilians in the area and to secure access for the crisis response teams. Their goal is to retake ADF-controlled areas and drive the militants out of the city. But the offensive has already claimed its victims: Seven UN peacekeepers and several Congolese soldiers have been killed so far.

Meanwhile, the fight to stop the spreading of Ebola is a race against the clock. It is crucial to stop the epidemic before it gets out of hand. But the fight against the region’s militia groups is not expected to end any time soon. Unless the medical teams get access to the affected areas, the situation could get much worse in just a matter of months.

Behind the scenes of the documentary:

""Reporting and filming in an Ebola-affected zone is challenging: It’s impossible to get close to those infected because of the high risk of infection: both the journalist and the equipment can be contaminated. The only way to protect yourself is to wear the same airtight suits, hoods and protective masks as the medical staff. Not an inch of your skin should be left uncovered.

The outside temperature, which under the Béni sun easily reaches around 35°C, is even more suffocating under the suit.

Once shooting is over, the most critical phase ensues: removing the potentially contaminated protective gear. It’s a long process in which you are sprayed with chlorine to kill the virus. The camera, also potentially contaminated, must be lowered in a bucket of chlorine.""

Doctors, public health officials, and governments are facing what is now the second largest Ebola outbreak in history. The death toll from this latest outbreak in the northeastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) already totals 245. And experts warn it could potentially spread within the DRC, as well as to neighboring countries.

The largest and deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, which began in 2014, claimed more than 11,000 lives before finally petering out in 2016.

What is different about this new outbreak, the DRC’s largest to date, is that it is occurring in a conflict zone. That makes identifying and treating Ebola patients extra difficult. Another difference is that we now have a highly effective — though still investigational — Ebola vaccine.

During the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, I was working at Merck. My colleagues and I, in partnership with many external collaborators, worked with unprecedented speed and urgency to develop, manufacture, and test an Ebola vaccine candidate that was originally created by scientists at the Public Health Agency of Canada. This vaccine candidate progressed from the first-in-human studies to evidence of vaccine effectiveness in only 10 months — a process that typically takes years. The vaccine was found to be 100 percent effective at preventing infection with Ebola when it was tested in a ring vaccination efficacy trial in Guinea.

The vaccine was not developed in time to have much of an impact on the 2014-2016 outbreak, but it is now being deployed through a compassionate use program in the DRC and Uganda to protect people at highest risk of Ebola infection, including contacts of individuals diagnosed with Ebola and front-line health care workers. The vaccine is one of several strategies being implemented to stymie this latest outbreak.

While the remarkable challenges of trying to control an Ebola outbreak in the midst of instability and violence have frustrated efforts to quash this outbreak, the situation would almost certainly have been worse in the absence of an effective vaccine.

The development of this Ebola vaccine candidate is a remarkable success story. It shows how public and private sectors can collaborate when they have a shared commitment to develop a highly effective and urgently needed vaccine.

We need to foster even more effective multi-sector partnerships to address other established public health threats like HIV and tuberculosis (TB), and to proactively prepare for other infectious disease threats that will emerge in the future.

Although HIV and TB may prove to be more intractable pathogens than the Ebola virus, neither will be defeated without effective vaccines. Fortunately, there is scientific and political momentum building on both fronts.

Despite tremendous strides in providing life-saving treatment to people living with HIV and multiple ways to prevent infection, the virus continues to spread at an alarming rate. Nearly 2 million people were newly infected with HIV last year.

The situation with TB is just as dire, if not more so. Although TB is treatable and even curable, which is not currently the case for HIV, 1.6 million people died last year as a result of TB infection, earning it many notorious distinctions: the most deadly infectious disease, the top killer of people living with HIV/AIDS, and the ninth leading cause of death around the world. Considering that an astonishing 10 million new cases of TB disease were reported last year, the overwhelming need for newer and better TB vaccines becomes brutally apparent.

Recent results from two TB vaccine trials are providing a new level of optimism that it should be possible to protect against this centuries-old pathogen by vaccination. A Phase IIb study involving more than 3,500 adult volunteers from Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia showed that the GSK investigational TB vaccine candidate, known as M72/AS01 E , was 54 percent effective overall at preventing active pulmonary TB disease in adults. Results from another recent clinical trial suggest that revaccinating adolescents with the only licensed TB vaccine, bacilli Calmette-Guérin (developed nearly 100 years ago), might offer another strategy for protecting against TB. This study showed that revaccinating South African adolescents with the same vaccine they received as infants was 45 percent effective in preventing sustained TB infection.

Efforts to develop a widely effective HIV vaccine are now focused on inducing highly specialized antibodies known as broadly neutralizing antibodies that are widely thought to offer the best hopes of protecting against the virus. Because these antibodies, which can potently block infection with diverse HIV variants, aren’t readily made by the immune system — they occur only rarely in response to natural HIV infection — researchers are exploring innovative techniques to try to develop vaccines that could provoke the immune systems of HIV-uninfected people to make them. The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, which I lead, and its partners recently advanced a vaccine candidate into clinical trials that seeks to do just that. Others in the field are trying additional approaches to reach the same goal.

Researchers working on both HIV and TB vaccines must redouble their efforts to expedite the development of promising candidates and use emerging insights in immunology to hasten the design and development of even better ones. Success will only come from innovative science and creative partnerships between the public and private sectors, much like those that were formed during the 2014-2016 Ebola crisis.

Defeating HIV and TB will ultimately depend on vaccines being affordable and accessible across the globe, particularly in the places where the burden of these diseases remains unacceptably high.

The outbreak, declared on August 1, has led to at least 198 confirmed deaths, DR Congo's health ministry said.

It is the tenth time in DR Congo since Ebola was first detected there in 1976 and centres around the restive eastern city of Beni in North Kivu, a region which has been blighted by armed conflict, which has hampered efforts to curb the outbreak.

Al Jazeera spoke to Dr Matshidiso Moeti, Regional Director of WHO Africa, about the spread of the outbreak, lessons learned from the earlier outbreaks, and what the future holds for health issues in Africa.

Al Jazeera: DRC's health minister called it the ""worst outbreak"" in the country's history. How difficult is it for the WHO to tackle it?

Matshidiso Moeti: This is happening in a zone where there's long-standing conflict. There is also a mistrust and the level of acceptance from the population has been a particular problem. Even as we're there, there have been attacks on communities, kidnappings, threats to our staff and even attacks.

We've been keen to work at community level, with various community groups, hoping to spread the word to everyone, including the armed groups. We want to tell them that when there's an Ebola outbreak, and the virus is circulating, we're all at risk, including them.

This is a combination of security issues and mistrust by the population, and even reluctance to cooperate sometimes. There are areas under the radar where the standard of infection control is very poor, they are some of the main areas where transmission is occurring and that has made the situation difficult and complicated.

This is a work in progress.

Al Jazeera: What kind of resistance did you meet from the communities?

Moeti: One of the biggest challenges has been the initial resistance from the communities. Some of them question why we're here now. They ask where we were when they were being killed by these armed groups and how we've taken notice once Ebola hit them.

One thing we're working on is safe and dignified burials. That's one of the biggest areas of contamination and infection. In African communities, we have traditions when it comes to births, marriages and death. This is when we remember our culture and go back to practice it.

Al Jazeera: How difficult is it to let families safely part with the bodies of loved ones?

Moeti: It is difficult. People don't find it easy to accept it. There has been resistance. But we've managed to do it effectively. One of the things is knowing who to work with, who has the trust of the community and a relationship with them - different leaders, religious leaders, women's groups, etc.

{articleGUID}

The investment in a dialogue with the community has also been important, not only for surveillance but also for building confidence in terms of persuading people to appreciate the risk and change their practices - how to deal with the loved ones who have died and essentially to hand them over for a safe burial.

Al Jazeera: How is that persuasion being done?

Moeti: For example, there is a very large number of small health clinics run by a number of health workers. This is a mix of traditional remedies and modern medicine but are not really regulated. This has been used and trusted by the population but this is where a lot of transmission has happened.

Now we're working with them on infection prevention and control. We're providing them with the material, knowledge and training needed so that if people visit, they understand and realise what they have to do to prevent transmission.

Al Jazeera: Malaria killed approximately 435,000 people last year, 93 percent of those in Africa. Last year, you told Al Jazeera ""progress was being made but it wasn't enough"". Why is progress still slow?

Moeti: The situation is still very similar. Twelve months is not a lot of time to turn a programme around…

Al Jazeera: ... but we're talking about more almost 400,000 deaths …

In other developments, health officials are starting to worry about the Ebola vaccine supply, especially if it's needed to curb widespread disease in one of the DRC's urban locations.

Latest cases in 8 cities

The 16 cases reflected in the health ministry's daily updates for Dec 1, 2, and 3 and were from eight different locations: Beni (5 cases), Katwa (3), Vuhovi (2), Kalunguta (2), Mutwanga (1), Komanda (1), Butembo (1), and Masereka (1).

Komanda is north of Beni and is in Ituri province, while the other locations are located south of the city. Katwa is located just east of Butembo, the largest urban setting for cases reported so far.

Twelve more deaths were reported, which involved 6 patients in Beni, 4 in Butembo, 1 in Butembo, and 1 in Komanda.

The latest developments lift the overall outbreak total to 444 cases, including 396 confirmed and 48 probable cases. The fatality count has reached 260 deaths.

Health officials are still investigating 72 suspected Ebola cases, with the number of people vaccinated reaching 39,277, roughly half of them from Beni, the outbreak's main hot spot.

Recruiting women for response

The health ministry said in its Dec 2 report that health officials have decided to take more steps to involve women in the outbreak response to strengthen community engagement, given that they are pillars of their household and play an important role in commercial activities.

The agency said workshops for women's groups recently took place in Beni and Butembo, and for the next month, the new communicators will be paired with response teams in the field to help ease some of the community resistance that is still present in some neighborhoods.

In the DRC's latest outbreak, females have made up a large number of cases—61% of confirmed and probable cases, according to totals at the end of November.

Concerns about vaccine supply

In other developments, as Ebola continues to spread in the DRC with no end of the outbreak in sight, health officials are starting to worry if the Ebola vaccine supply would run short if the virus spreads more widely in urban locations like Butembo, where several cases have already been reported, or in Goma, North Kivu province's capital, Stat reported today.

The concerns about the vaccine supply were aired by Peter Salama, MD, the World Health Organization (WHO) deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response. He told Stat that officials are regularly in touch with Merck, the vaccine's developer which has committed to maintain a 300,000-dose stockpile. As of yesterday, 42,000 doses has been used between the DRC's two Ebola outbreaks this year, an earlier event in Equateur province in the west and the current outbreak centered in North Kivu province in the east.

Salama told Stat that Beni's population is 400,000 and Butembo's numbers about 1 million, which would quickly exhaust vaccine supplies if the immunization strategy shifts from the current ring vaccination to a broader geographic approach, as some have suggested.

Merck told Stat that it takes about a year to produce a batch of vaccine, and while some of the stockpiled vaccine is already in vials, much is kept in bulk, which can take 4 to 5 months to put into vials.

Dec 3 Stat story",no result found,no result found,no result found,"The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo appears to be spreading southward from its current epicenter at Beni, raising concerns it will take root in some larger population centers, including a major regional hub, warned a senior World Health Organization official.

Should the outbreak spread more widely in cities like Butembo — where there have already been a number of cases — or Goma, a major center further south, the scale of the outbreak could tax the available supplies of an experimental vaccine being used to help contain spread, said Dr. Peter Salama, who heads the WHO’s emergencies program.

As of Sunday more than 42,000 doses of the vaccine had been used in this outbreak and one earlier in the year in the western part of the DRC. Merck, which is developing the vaccine, has committed itself to maintaining a stockpile of 300,000 doses.

“We are extremely concerned about the size of the vaccine stockpile,” Salama told STAT in an interview. “And we’re regularly in touch with Merck to discuss what can be done about that.”

This outbreak, centered in the province of North Kivu in northeastern DRC, is now the second largest in known history, with 440 cases and 255 deaths as of Sunday. That is massive in traditional Ebola outbreak terms, but still pales in comparison to the West African outbreak of 2014-2016, where more than 28,000 people were infected and more than 11,000 died.

“We are extremely concerned about the size of the vaccine stockpile.” Dr. Peter Salama, WHO

The vaccine is being used in a ring vaccination approach. People who have been in close contact with cases — and the contacts of those contacts — are offered vaccine. The idea is to hem in the virus and prevent onward transmission.

Frontline workers such as healthcare providers, ambulance drivers, and people who conduct safe burials of the Ebola dead are also offered the chance to be vaccinated. On a few occasions when vaccination teams knew they would have limited access to a village or neighborhood because of the threat of violence, they offered vaccine to all comers.

There have been calls from some outside observers to use that geographic approach more broadly to try to extinguish this outbreak, which likely began in late April and is expected to continue well into next year. Salama has resisted these calls.

“When you consider that the global … stockpile is 300,000 doses and Beni itself has a population of 400,000 and Butembo a million, you can imagine that when people are proposing large scale geographical vaccination that becomes extremely impractical,” he said.

Merck has told STAT it takes about a year, start to finish, to produce a batch of the vaccine, which it has provisionally called V920. Some of the vaccine in the stockpile is already in vials, but much of it is stored in bulk. Converting the bulk product into vaccine in vials can take between four and five months, a Merck spokeswoman explained.

Salama suggested the size of the Ebola vaccine stockpile will need to be reconsidered in future, saying he doesn’t think 300,000 doses is sufficient. “I don’t believe that’s adequate for urban outbreaks. And … I think urban outbreaks are increasingly going to be the norm, including urban outbreaks in conflict-affected areas,” he said.

Salama expects this epidemic — occurring in a densely populated region with massive political instability — will take at least another six months to contain. “And that’s if security holds,” he said.

There have been sporadic rebel attacks on Beni, where the outbreak response efforts are headquartered. Recently a number of response team staff were evacuated to Goma for some counseling and rest after their hotel was caught in the crossfire during an attack on the nearby U.N. peacekeepers’s encampment. They have all since returned to Beni, Salama said.

Transmission in Beni appears to be subsiding, he said, with containment efforts making inroads. While that is good news, the southward spread of cases is dampening moods.

“None of us would ever like to see a scenario where we have an outbreak in Goma,” said Salama. “It’s a very big city and it’s also a crossroads in Eastern Africa in terms of transportation. Air. Road. Truck. Everything.”"

There are now 453 cases (220 confirmed and 48 probable), including 268 deaths. Seventy-one people are still under investigation for possible infections.

Concerns about cases around Butembo

Yesterday, Doctors without Borders (MSF), one of the key response organizations working on this outbreak, said that several new cases have been in remote areas surrounding Butembo, one of the largest cities in North Kivu.

""We are very concerned by the epidemiological situation in the Butembo area,"" said John Johnson, MSF project coordinator in Butembo, in a press release. Though the number of cases in recent days in Butembo is low, more cases in isolated districts to the east of the city have been appearing.

""We're expecting this outbreak will last for a while, and we must increase our efforts to get it under control. With the agreement of the authorities, we have made a strategic decision to roll out our activities close to the affected populations and to organize training of key people in the community so that we can reach patients and their relatives,"" Johnson said.

MSF said the number of beds at the Ebola treatment center (ETC) in Butembo has doubled in recent weeks, from fewer than 30 when the outbreak began in August to 64. MSF also opened a 48-bed transit center in Beni, the town that's been the epicenter of the outbreak in the past 2 months.

MSF also said at least 2,000 vaccine recipients have been frontline health workers. According to the DRC ministry of health, 39,845 people have been vaccinated in the country.

Spurt of new cases in Komanda

Today, 6 of the new cases were reported in Komanda in Ituri province, one of the towns north of Butembo. And three deaths in Komanda were listed as ""community deaths,"" which means they did not occur in an ETC or hospital.

Such cases raise the risk of transmission, because virus levels are at their highest at the time of death, and people caring for loved ones in community lack the type of personal protective equipment found in healthcare settings.

Officials from the DRC said the outbreak was linked to a confirmed case from Beni who died at an ETC last week. A vaccination team was dispatched to Komanda on Monday and has been vaccinating contacts.

The other three cases reported today were from Beni, Katwa, and Mabalako. Also, the ministry said eight more people died from their infections, lifting the fatality count to 268.

WHO says more US involvement not needed

According to the Associated Press (AP), World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, told reporters yesterday in Geneva that the WHO could ""cover"" the Ebola outbreak, in response to two recent editorials in the New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA Network Open by American public health experts who argue the United States needs to send healthcare workers to the DRC to stop the outbreak.

In September the US State Department under White House orders pulled US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff and other personnel from the region citing local violence and security concerns. CDC Director Robert Redfield, MD, has gone on record saying he disagrees with the decision. The CDC is currently sharing data and analysis with the WHO.

""We can mobilize from other parts, from those institutions who don't have very strict security provisions like that,"" Tedros told reporters at WHO headquarters, the AP said. ""We can cover it.""

Dec 3 MSF press release

Dec 3 AP story",no result found,no result found,no result found,"Health workers move a patient to a hospital in Butembo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, after he was cleared of having Ebola.

The term “randomized controlled trial” conjures up images of sterile, high-tech labs with closely monitored patients hooked up to numerous machines. That’s a far cry from the reality of a brave and groundbreaking trial that began last week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to investigate lifesaving treatments for Ebola.

The DRC is in the midst of one of the worst Ebola outbreaks it has faced. With at least 260 people killed so far, it is the second-worst Ebola epidemic the world has faced.

This Ebola outbreak is spreading in an incredibly challenging region. It is affecting dense, urban areas, close to national borders, making transmission more likely. And many cases have emerged in extremely hostile and dangerous areas that are under attack from rebel groups and served by bad or nonexistent roads and limited electricity.

advertisement

This situation puts health care workers and communities at risk from both disease and violence. Providing care, gathering data, tracing contacts, and making the vaccine — the legacy of the West African epidemic — available in this region is almost impossible.

Given these formidable conditions, why attempt a clinical trial?

Several experimental treatments have been given to 174 people infected with Ebola in the DRC under compassionate use. But we don’t know which one is the safest and most effective. Determining that can only happen during an outbreak or epidemic, when people have Ebola. Most clinical trials exclude pregnant women and children. That’s not the case here. Women and children will be included in the trial because of Ebola’s high mortality rate. It’s essential that they take part, given recent news that more babies and young children are being diagnosed than in previous outbreaks.

To get enough data, the clinical trials may have to span multiple outbreaks. But once we know if an Ebola treatment can save lives, we can make sure the vaccine or drug is licensed, available, and affordable to those who need it, where ever they are.

Making the decision to go ahead with the trial has not been easy. It is a highly complex undertaking. We should all pay tribute to the brave health care workers who are providing the best possible care and conducting this trial.

During difficult times, it can be all too easy to turn our backs and hide behind complexity as an excuse not to act. This important step forward has been made possible only through close collaboration between researchers, governments, nongovernmental organizations, companies, and funders.

There is no question that the current Ebola outbreak in the DRC would be far, far worse if there were no vaccine available. That vaccine exists only because of a trial in the devastating multiyear epidemic in West Africa — a trial that many at the time said was just too difficult to do.

To date, more than 42,000 people have received the vaccine in the DRC and not a single vaccinated person has been diagnosed with Ebola. But as effective as the vaccine may be, it alone will not be enough to keep this deadly disease at bay.

The world has learned a lot since the West Africa epidemic that took more than 11,000 lives. Yet we still dangerously underestimate our vulnerability. Epidemics strike suddenly. Governmental instability, climate change, conflict, and migration make it easier than ever for diseases to spread across countries. Just look at the effect the cholera epidemic is having in Yemen.

It’s time to stop reacting to these outbreaks as discrete episodes and instead work together with a coordinated, nationally led, and internationally supported approach that learns from each outbreak so we can better prepare for the next.

Multi-outbreak, multi-country trials are essential if we’re to find the best treatments for patients and the best vaccines. This trial, led by the DRC with the support of the National Institutes of Health; Medecins Sans Frontieres; ALIMA; the African Coalition for Epidemic Research, Response, and Training; the World Health Organization; industry; and others shows it can be done.

We won’t ever get rid of Ebola, but we can stop outbreaks of it from turning into major regional and national epidemics. This trial of treatments, and the vaccines we now have available, offer hope that we can turn this terrifying disease into a preventable and treatable one, ensuring the loss of as few lives as possible.

The new cases lift the outbreak total to 458, which includes 410 confirmed and 48 probable cases. The death total is 263, and health officials are still investigating 75 suspected cases.

Per-week cases decline

In a weekly report from the WHO African regional office that covered 28 cases reported between Nov 23 and Dec 1, the group said the number of illnesses declined from 46 reported the week before. Weekly deaths dropped from 22 reported 2 weeks ago to 19 last week.

Three more infections were reported in healthcare workers, raising the total to 43 illnesses in health workers, 12 of them fatal.

Based on locations of cases reported over the past 3 week weeks, Beni, Katwa, and Kalunguta are still the hot spots.

Contact tracing, a key part of the outbreak response, is still challenging because of insecurity and pockets of community resistance. Of contacts lost to follow-up, most were from Beni. The report said, however, that the search for lost contacts has been intensified, especially in Beni.

Efforts are also under way to address community resistance and security concerns. For example, the WHO said a group of youth leaders who were hostile to safe and dignified burial and vaccination have been trained and integrated into response teams. And negotiations are still underway with armed groups in Kalunguta, considered a security ""red zone,"" allow response activities to resume.

'Grave concern,' yet hope

Officials said though the DRC's Ebola outbreak is still a ""grave concern,"" they expressed hope that intensified community engagement and contact tracing efforts will turn the tide in the outbreak's evolution.

Looking ahead, health officials say the next challenge could be large public gatherings during upcoming election campaigns, which could increase the threat of virus spread. The general election is slated for Dec 23 to replace President Joseph Kabila.

The report said a plan has been developed to strengthen epidemiologic surveillance during election season.

Dec 4 WHO African regional office weekly outbreak and emergencies update",no result found,no result found,"DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Aid agencies working in the Democratic Republic of Congo have accused the United Nations of manipulating data ahead of elections to give an overly positive impression of the situation in a country beset by conflict and disease.

They say new figures from the U.N. humanitarian agency that show a large drop in the number of displaced people are misleading, accusing it of bowing to government pressure before a presidential election scheduled for December 23.

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Congo said it did not manipulate data and that it is in ongoing discussions with agencies on the issue.

The government also rejected the accusation, saying aid agencies deliberately exaggerated crises to increase funding.

The vast country is battling an Ebola outbreak as well as multiple armed conflicts that have been aggravated by President Joseph Kabila’s refusal to step down at the end of his elected mandate in 2016.

Last year the U.N. said there were 4.5 million internally displaced people - forced to flee their homes and unable to return - in the Congo. But in a statement last month it estimated just 1.37 million would need assistance in 2019.

It also put the overall number of people in need at 12.8 million, a slight decrease from last year, although a separate, international food security tracking system has estimated the number suffering from acute hunger alone at 13.1 million, up from 7.7 million last year.

“Overall humanitarian needs have risen during 2018 rather than decreased,” a group representing about 45 humanitarian agencies said in a letter to the U.N. seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

“Such cynical manipulation of critical data distorts the reality of the situation on the ground and compromises humanitarians’ ability to communicate effectively on the gravity of the crisis.”

A spokesman for OCHA in Congo said the disagreement stemmed from a “difference in perception of the data”, but declined to elaborate.

The U.N. Global Humanitarian Overview, which lays out the situation for 2019, was published on Tuesday and did not include the disputed figure for the number of displaced.

It said 2.9 million internally displaced people (IDPs) were expected to return home due to security improvements in Congo - a projection that aid workers dispute.

“IDP figures have never been and never should be up for negotiation. These are human lives we are talking about here,” one humanitarian professional told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on condition of anonymity.

“The U.N. should know better than to use these lives as political ping-pong.”

Tensions are running high ahead of the election to replace Kabila that could lead to the country’s first democratic transition of power.

The government in March boycotted an international aid conference in Geneva after the U.N. declared the crisis to be at a Level 3, the highest-level emergency.

The government said at the time this was an exaggeration that was discouraging investment and demanded that humanitarian statistics be brought in line with its own.

Government spokesman Lambert Mende said on Tuesday the figures included in the new response plan were accurate.

“We are not going to exaggerate figures to please NGOs who are looking for funding,” he said.

Aid agencies said downplaying the number of people fleeing violence would impact their ability to help millions.

While violence has decreased in some regions allowing for people to return home, it has increased in other places - such as Ituri and North Kivu provinces - over the past year, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

“Globally the displacement problem in DRC has remained widespread and in parts of the country very dramatic,” said UNHCR spokesman Andreas Kirchhof.

“We don’t see that there is an enormous improvement in many areas over the past months. In many regions it has even deteriorated.”",no result found
6-Dec-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

Responding to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in north-eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be a multifaceted challenge. By utilising proven public health measures (contact tracing, engaging communities) as well as new tools at hand (vaccine and therapeutics), WHO remains confident the outbreak can be contained and brought to an end.

During the reporting period (28 November – 4 December 2018), 35 new cases were reported from nine health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces: Beni (8), Komanda (eight), Katwa (eight), Vuhovi (three), Kalunguta (two), Butembo (two), Mabalako (two), Masereka (one), and Mutwanga (one). Recent cases in Komanda and Mabalako health zones follow an extended period (exceeding two incubation periods) without detection of new cases; highlighting the risk of reintroduction of the virus, and the need to maintain enhanced surveillance. Cases in the Komanda originated from an infection of a mother and her children in Beni. While insecurity in Komanda will challenge the response activities, control measures including contact tracing and vaccination were initiated soon after the detection of cases.

Public and private health centres with inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) practices continue to be major source of amplification of the outbreak. During the reporting period, two new infections were reported in health workers, and at least one new case likely acquired EVD from an infected health worker during a routine visit. Altogether, 44 health workers (41 nurses and three doctors) have been infected to date, of which 59% (26) were female.

As of the reporting period, 21 additional survivors were discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) in Beni (12) and Butembo (nine) and reintegrated into their communities. A total of 142 patients have recovered to date.

As of 4 December, 458 EVD cases (410 confirmed and 48 probable), including 271 deaths, have been reported in 11 health zones in North Kivu Province and three health zones in Ituri Province (Figure 1). The epidemiological curve (Figure 2) of the outbreak shows two distinct phases. The first phase was centred in Mangina and was largely brought under control within a month. The second wave, dispersed across many areas, has continued for over two months with approximately five new cases per day. Given the expected delays in case detection and reporting in the recent weeks, overall trends in weekly case incidence must be interpreted cautiously.

The risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains very high. Over the course of the past week, alerts have been reported from several provinces within the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Uganda; EVD has been ruled out for all alerts to date.

Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 4 December 2018*

*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning – trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.

Ebola virus disease in women and children

Concerns have been raised regarding the disproportionate number of women and children infected during this outbreak (Figure 3). To date, females accounted for 62% (280/450) of overall cases where sex was reported. Of all female cases, 83% (230/277) were aged ≥15 years. Of these women, at least 18 were pregnant, and an additional seven were breastfeeding or recently delivered at the time of infection. There have been 27 cases among infants less than one year of age, with 70% (19) of these being boys, and 21 fatalities (age-specific case fatality of 78%). There were also nine cases in infants aged less than one month. Children less than 15 years of age accounted for 24% (106/447) of cases.

There are likely a multitude of factors contributing towards this disproportionate disease burden observed in women and children. These include: exposure within formal and informal health facilities, involvement in traditional burial practices, transmission within family groups (including transmission between mothers caring for children), differences in health seeking behaviour, as well as the impact of ongoing conflict on the underlying population structure in affected areas. Among those with available information, commonly identified risk factors reported by cases include: having contact to a known case (224/320, 70%), having attended funerals (121/299, 40%) and having visited/admitted to a health facility before onset of EVD (46/139, 33%). Of note, 46% of female cases (84/181) reported having attended funerals, in contrast to 31% of male cases (37/118).

A concurrent increase in cases of malaria and the inadequate accompanying IPC in health settings are also likely to be contributory to the high rates of EVD among children. The recent conclusion of a four-day malaria control campaign in Beni on 2 December aimed at preventing further malaria deaths, as well as lessen the burden on health centres in order to address this potential source of transmission.

The MoH, WHO, are actively working with UNICEF and other partners to address the increased risks observed in women (including pregnant or breastfeeding women) and young children, and further strengthen measures to prevent and manage infections in these groups.

Figure 3: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by gender and age group, data as of 4 December 2018

*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning and reclassification – trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. Infection prevention and control practices in health care facilities, especially antenatal clinics need to be further strengthened. Stringent hand hygiene is essential.

For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO’s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advice against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Six of the new cases are in Butembo, three in Oicha, and two each in Beni and Katwa.

The outbreak totals now stand at 471 cases, of which 423 are confirmed and 48 are probable; 273 people have died. And the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday that it is concerned about reintroduction of the virus into the outbreak region.

Officials confirmed five new deaths yesterday and today, including a community death in Komanda, which raises the risk of transmission among care givers. A total of 106 suspected cases are still under investigation, the DRC health ministry said.

Facing violence, community resistance

Today Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, the DRC's minister of health, held a press conference in Kinshasa to update the public on the outbreak, now in its fifth month. He said the past 3 weeks have seen cases spike in Butembo and Katwa, and he attributed the increase to three major causes.

First, Kalenga said these communities are marked by high population density and mobility, as it is the major trading region of North Kivu. He also said that small pockets of violent, community resistance have limited response efforts at time.

""The expression of reluctance by the community is more violent than the reluctance usually observed during previous Ebola outbreaks,"" Kalenga said. ""A minority of the population in these areas express their reluctance through the regular destruction of medical equipment and health centers as well as the physical attacks of health workers.""

Finally, Kalenga said that 44 health workers have contracted Ebola during this outbreak, or 9% of the case total, and 12 have died. Infections in healthcare workers are always problematic during Ebola outbreaks, as they lead to nosocomial infections, he said.

Kalenga estimated that tens of thousands of Congolese have been protected from the disease through the use Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine, which has been used throughout the region since August. As of today, 41,226 people have been vaccinated, including 3,556 in Butembo.

DRC, Uganda coordinate responses

Yesterday health officials from the DRC and neighboring Uganda met in Goma for a bilateral information exchange, which aimed to strengthen disease surveillance on the border.

According to All Africa, the countries agreed to mapping common border crossing points for joint screening.

Also yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its 18th situation report on the outbreak. From Nov 27 to Dec 3, officials confirmed 31 Ebola cases in eight health districts.

""The health zones of Komanda, Masereka and Mabalako have reported one new confirmed case each, respectively 61 days, 48 days and 56 days after confirmation of previously confirmed cases, and investigations are ongoing regarding links and travel history from other areas to these cases,"" the WHO said. It added that the reemergence of Ebola in these three zones highlights the possibility of virus reintroduction in communities throughout North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

The WHO said the outbreak remains ""serious and unpredictable."" Contact surveillance activity continues, with 5,335 people being actively traced as of Dec 3. On average, health workers receive 212 alerts to possible infections per day, of which 64 are validated as suspected cases.

Bangui (Central African Republic) (AFP)

The line of parents waiting to see doctors stretches back outside the hospital into the dusty courtyard. Mums and dads carrying weak, starving children. Many hanging limply in their arms like half empty sacks of rice.

The scene at the paediatric complex in Bangui, capital of Central African Republic, is not dissimilar to a war zone. And as conflict tears through the country, people here are desperately fighting another deadly foe: hunger.

In a doorway, a young girl stands with the round shape of her belly protruding out above her skinny legs.

A few metres away another malnourished girl sits barefoot, joints protruding, with shoulder blades poking out of her skin like blades, a baggy top the only clothing to cling to her perished frame.

""Central African Republic is one of the most difficult countries to be a child,"" Donaig Le Dru, UNICEF spokesperson in CAR, told AFP.

The statistics underline the horrors that stalk childhood in the country.

Infant mortality in CAR is the highest in the world, according to the UN.

One in 24 children die in the first 28 days of life.

The number of children with severe or acute malnutrition rose from around 32,000 to 43,000 between 2014 and the end of 2018.

And two out of three children -- 1.5 million youngsters in total -- are in need of humanitarian assistance, according to UNICEF.

The UN's World Food Programme warned last month that CAR was facing the worst situation of food insecurity in four years, with nearly two million people in urgent need of food aid.

- 'More dangerous for children' -

Civil unrest has lacerated this impoverished but mineral-rich country for years, leaving the economy in tatters and causing misery for those caught in the violence.

In a report released last month, the UN expressed alarm over a ""sharp increase in fighting"" and said ""life may be even harder and more dangerous for children"" than it was at the height of the last outbreak of civil war five years ago.

One of the world's poorest countries, the CAR spiralled into bloodshed after longtime leader Francois Bozize was overthrown in 2013 by a predominantly Muslim rebel alliance called the Seleka.

Nominally Christian militias called the anti-Balaka emerged in response, accelerating a cycle of sectarian violence.

France intervened militarily from 2013 to 2016 to push out the Seleka, winding down the operation after Faustin-Archange Touadera was elected president.

Touadera governs today with the support of a large UN peacekeeping operation. But most of the country is controlled by ex-rebels and militias, many of them claiming to act as guardians for the Muslim or Christian communities.

- Severe malnutrition -

The Bangui hospital is just a few kilometres from the mainly Muslim PK5 district -- an area that has become a flashpoint in the troubled country.

But just five paediatricians work here, struggling with limited equipment or support eked out of the creaking healthcare system.

Inside the hospital, a group of parents and children stare at a malnourished girl crying during what has become a daily routine -- being weighed on scales in a large blue bucket.

One by one, the children are lifted onto the scales as other emaciated infants and parents look on, waiting their turn.

In the overcrowded hospital grounds, a father called Theodore hugs his young daughter who is suffering from malnutrition.

His wife is in hospital after having a nervous breakdown, he says, after the couple's first child died. He struggles to earn enough money to buy food.

In general, children are hospitalised for a little over a week until their weight recovers.

But not all survive, with some losing the fight against severe malnutrition or disease -- the lasting consequences of violence and poverty in a nation wracked by conflict.

In other developments, the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed new details about its investigation into a spurt of new cases in Komanda, a part of Ituri province that had not reported cases for several weeks.

ADF rebels attack civilians

Beni has been the setting for several attacks in recent months, some of which led to temporary pauses in Ebola response operations. In the latest incidents, Ugandan rebels with the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) killed 18 civilians in two separate attacks, according to a report from Radio Okapi, a news network run by the United Nations mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) and the Fondation Hirondelle, a Swiss nongovernmental organization.

According to the report, the first incident occurred yesterday morning in Mangolikene, about 9 miles northeast of Beni, where the ADF attacked farmers in their fields, killing 13. The second attack occurred yesterday evening in Paida district in the eastern outskirts of Beni, killing 5 people and wounding 2 more.

The fresh violence comes about 3 weeks after a joint mission between MONUSCO and DRC government fighters targeted an ADF stronghold near Beni, which resulted in the deaths of 7 UN peacekeepers.

Six new cases, 2 more deaths

In its daily update today, the DRC's health ministry reported six more confirmed Ebola cases, including four in Katwa, located east of Butembo, and two in Beni. Also, two more deaths were reported, one from Beni and the other from Butembo.

The developments lift the overall outbreak total to 477 cases, 429 of them confirmed and 48 listed as probable. The fatality count has risen to 275.

Health officials are still investigating 94 suspected Ebola cases.

In vaccination developments, the health ministry said wide-belt immunization, presumably broader than the standard ring vaccination strategy, is under way in reemerging hot spots, Komanda and Mabalako health zones. Overall, 41,817 people have received Merck's VSV-EBOV vaccine since the campaign began in August.

Resurgence in earlier hot spots

In a weekly snapshot of the DRC's Ebola outbreak, the WHO said the event continues to be a ""multifaceted challenge,"" but it is still confident the outbreak can be contained with proven steps and new tools, such as vaccines and therapies.

The agency said new cases in Komanda and Mabalako emerged after more than two Ebola incubation periods had passed with no new cases, underscoring the risk of reintroduction and the need to keep up enhanced surveillance. Komanda's cases are linked to an infection of a mother and her children in Beni.

""While insecurity in Komanda will challenge the response activities, control measures including contact tracing and vaccination were initiated soon after the detection of cases,"" the WHO added.

Another factor fueling some of the latest cases is inadequate infection prevention and control practices at public and private health centers, a situation known to amplify Ebola outbreaks. So far, 44 health workers have been infected in the outbreak—12 fatally—and at least one of the newly reported patients likely contracted Ebola from an infected health worker during a routine medical visit, the WHO said.

Infections in women, children

Also, the WHO addressed concerns about the disproportionate number of women and children infected in the outbreak. So far, females account for 62% of cases, and of that group 18 were pregnant and 7 were breastfeeding or had recently delivered.

The virus has infected 27 babies younger than 1 year old, and killed 21 of them. Nine infections have been recorded in newborns, and children younger than 15 years make up 24% of all of the outbreak cases.

Several factors are probably contributing to the higher burden in women and children, the WHO said, including exposure in health settings, participation in traditional burial practices, transmission within families, and differences in health-seeking behavior. A spike in malaria cases and inadequate infection control practices in healthcare settings are also probably playing a role in in high Ebola rates in children, according to the report.

BENI, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Suspected militiamen have killed at least 18 civilians in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, near the epicenter of an Ebola outbreak, an army spokesman said on Friday.

Repeated attacks by armed groups on civilians, Congolese soldiers and U.N. peacekeepers have hampered efforts to contain the epidemic, the second worst in history.

So far, it is believed to have infected 471 people and killed 273 of them. Congo’s health ministry announced 13 new confirmed cases on Thursday, one of the highest one-day totals since the outbreak was declared in August.

A local army spokesman, Captain Mak Hazukay, told Reuters the civilians were killed late on Thursday during two separate attacks near the town of Beni.

“They killed some of them and took others hostage ... dragged them into the suburbs, where they burned down a house and savagely executed the hostages,” he said.

A Reuters witness saw the bullet-riddled bodies of five women on the outskirts of Beni. Hazukay, also present on the scene, said another 13 bodies were lying in the woods nearby.

A local civil society leader, Kizito Bin Hangi, said the attack was carried out by militants belonging to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group active in the area.

Congolese authorities blame ADF rebels for dozens of attacks over the past four years that have killed more than 1,000 civilians, although independent experts say other armed groups and Congolese soldiers are responsible for some of the killings.

The attacks have undermined health authorities’ ability to reach patients and others exposed to Ebola. Mistrust of first responders has also led some locals to refuse treatment or safe burials, aggravating the outbreak.","Sponsored by The latest on the Ebola outbreak in DRC The case counts in the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo now stand at 471 cases and 273 deaths. A new WHO report unpacks some devastating details about the outbreak: Children 14 and younger make up one-quarter of the cases. It’s thought they’re getting infected in clinics when they are brought in for malaria care.

Of the cases, 27 have been children under the age of 1, and 21 of those children have died. Nine of the infected infants were less than 1 month old.

Among the cases, there were 18 pregnant women and seven women who were breastfeeding or had recently delivered. Uterine cancer deaths are climbing Deaths due to uterine cancer are on the rise, the CDC reports. Uterine cancer is one of just a few cancers in the U.S. for which rates are increasing. New data show that uterine cancer rates rose 0.7 percent per year from 1999 to 2015, while death rates rose 1.1 percent each year from 1999 to 2016. Black women were twice as likely as other women to be diagnosed with uterine cancer that’s harder to treat, and they were also more likely to die from uterine cancer. The CDC says it’s critical to raise awareness about the need to have abnormal bleeding — a symptom of uterine cancer — checked out by a health care provider. Talking to patients and families could cut down on harmful medical errors A new study suggests a simple idea could help curb medical errors: talk to patients and families more. Researchers tested a program designed to improve communication during rounds, when providers check in each day about a hospitalized patient’s care. It lays out a set of steps: go to a patient's bedside, ask if the patient or family has any concerns, explain the treatment plan without any medical jargon, and then make sure they understood. Researchers taught the program to providers at seven U.S. hospitals and found that the rate of harmful, preventable errors fell by 38 percent. The takeaway: “Families are really valuable, but sometimes underrecognized, part of care,” says study author Dr. Alisa Khan. Progress on secondhand smoke exposure stalls For decades, there have been significant strides in reducing secondhand smoke exposure among people in the U.S. who don’t smoke — but now, that progress seems to have stalled. A new analysis of national health data finds that secondhand smoke exposure among non-smokers fell from 88 percent in 1988 to 25 percent in 2014. But the rate hasn’t changed from 2011 to 2014. And there are persistent disparities in who is exposed to secondhand smoke. Children ages 3 to 11, black individuals, and people who live in rental housing are all more likely to be exposed. Inside STAT: Democrats eye pharma's patents as a drug pricing target Newly empowered Democrats in D.C. are on the hunt for bigger and bolder ways to lower drug prices. And they’re taking aim at a central part of pharma’s monopoly power: the patents the industry holds on drugs. The drug industry’s intellectual property rights have long seemed untouchable — the argument is that messing with a government-granted monopoly will lead to investments in research and development disappearing. But after a midterm election that saw voters more focused on drug prices than ever, progressives are taking aim at the intellectual property monopolies that give pharma the ability to charge sky-high prices. STAT’s Lev Facher has the story here. Could an experimental drug treat cannabis use disorder? New results from a randomized trial suggest that an experimental drug might help ease withdrawal symptoms in men with cannabis use disorder — but experts caution more research is needed. People with cannabis use disorder can experience cravings, withdrawal, and other issues. In a study of 70 men, those who received the drug had fewer withdrawal symptoms and used less marijuana after four weeks than men on a placebo. In a commentary tied to the study, University of Toronto's Dr. Tony George noted the study seemed to exclude adults with psychiatric conditions and didn’t look at functional impairments. George said the drug needs to be studied in more patients over more time. What to read around the web today The growing movement to unite genetic families. WBUR

The long-delayed elections will mark Congo’s first democratic transfer of power and an end to Kabila’s rule that began in 2001 after the assassination of his father.

Kabila, 47, was due to step down in 2016 at the end of his constitutional mandate. But the election to replace him was repeatedly delayed, igniting protests in which dozens were killed.

Until recently it was unclear if he would seek a third consecutive term. He will be eligible to run again in 2023 after a break.

Kabila hand-picked a loyalist named Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary as candidate for the ruling coalition. Shadary is under European Union sanctions for his alleged involvement in human rights violations. Congo’s government says the sanctions, which include a travel ban and asset freeze, are illegal.

Polls show little-known Shadary far behind popular leading opposition figures, raising speculation that he is merely there to serve one term before Kabila returns.

“Why don’t we wait for 2023 ... to envision anything,” said a relaxed, smiling Kabila in a rare interview at the presidential palace, wearing a dark blue suit and tie and sporting his signature graying goatee.

“In life as in politics, I don’t rule out anything.”

The delay in elections has coincided with a breakdown in security across much of the mineral-rich country. Militants fight over land and resources in the east near the border with Uganda and Rwanda. The violence has allowed an Ebola outbreak to spread to become the second largest ever recorded. [nL8N1Y163O]

International observers say insecurity will make holding elections difficult in the vast equatorial country and create an opportunity for Kabila’s coalition to cheat, especially with the use of new voting machines.

Kabila said Congo was ready to hold fair elections.

“We intend to make the elections as close to perfection as they can possibly be,” he said. “Observers who think that the elections will not be free and fair, I am yet to see those observers come and state where they think we are lacking.”

NO REGRETS

Kabila was catapulted to power aged 29, after his father Laurent was shot dead in 2001 by a bodyguard. The assassination occurred during a civil war that raged from 1998 till 2003 and killed 5 million people, mostly through hunger and disease.

He promised to restore peace and end corruption and today stands by his legacy despite leaving behind a fragile economy and multiple protracted armed conflicts that have forced millions to flee their homes.

“Do we have regrets? No, not at all. We have many accomplishments. The biggest is that we managed...to reunify this country and put it back on the right track,” he said.

Kabila said he wants to remain in politics to protect those accomplishments, adding that judgments could wait until his career was fully over.

New cases in multiple locations

Of the 13 new cases, 3 are in Mabalako, one of the initial hot spots that has seen a recent resurgence of Ebola activity. Four patients are from Katwa, an area just east of Butembo, and 2 are in Beni, the outbreak's main epicenter. Four more locations each reported 1 case: Mambasa, Kyondo, Butembo, and Vuhovi.

In its Dec 8 update, the DRC health ministry added 8 older cases to the total, part of ongoing efforts to clean up the database. That and the new cases lifts the overall outbreak total to 498 cases, 450 of them confirmed and 48 listed as probable.

Also over the past 3 days, the health ministry reported 9 more deaths, including 2 in Beni, 2 in Mabalako, 2 in Butembo, and 1 each in Mambasa, Katwa, and Vuhovi. The death toll as of today stands at 285.

The two patients from Mabalako and the ones from Katwa and Vuhovi are all listed as community deaths, occurrences that pose a high risk of spread, given that Ebola virus levels are highest during severe illness and at the time of death. Also, those caring for sick people at home don't have the personal protective equipment found in Ebola treatment units.

In its update today, the health ministry said that, over the past 6 weeks, Ebola cases and deaths have been increasing in Butembo and Katwa because of community resistance, health infrastructure destructions, and physical aggression faced by response teams. At a media briefing in Kinshasa on Dec 6, Heath Minister Oly Ilunga Ilunga, MD, called the increase disturbing and said more teams are being sent to Butembo, a major urban area, and surrounding health zones to strengthen response operations.

Health officials are still investigating 73 suspected Ebola cases. In its Dec 8 report, the health ministry said a patient who died from a suspected Ebola infection at a hospital about 62 miles northwest of Goma, the provincial capital, tested negative for the disease. It commended the hospital's medical team for calling the toll-free emergency number, isolating the patient's body, and identifying contacts while lab testing was under way.

Meanwhile, the number of people vaccinated continues to rise, and the VSV-EBOV campaign has immunized 43,944 people.

South Sudan to immunize at-risk people

In other outbreak developments, South Sudan's health ministry, with support from several health partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, announced plans to vaccine healthcare and frontline workers in high-risk states that border the DRC.

South Sudan is one of three DRC neighbors deemed to be at very high risk of Ebola importation. The country is on high alert, but no confirmed cases have been detected. The step is part of South Sudan's national preparedness efforts and follows a similar campaign announced last month to vaccinate the same groups against Ebola in Uganda.

In a Dec 8 statement, the WHO's South Sudan office said a 60-person vaccination team underwent 4 days of training in the country's capital city of Juba last week. Members are from four states: Juba, Yei, Yambio, and Nimule.

According to the WHO, 2,160 doses of VSV-EBOV, Merck's experimental Ebola vaccine, have been allocated for the South Sudan campaign, and vaccination is slated to begin on Dec 19 in Juba. Those who are vaccinated will be followed up for 21 days.

Dec 8 WHO South Sudan office statement",no result found,no result found,"(Reuters) - Some 2,000 healthcare and frontline workers in South Sudan are to be offered Ebola vaccines to try to stop any importation of the viral disease from an epidemic in Congo, the World Health Organization said on Monday.

South Sudan is one of the three countries - with Uganda and Rwanda - that the WHO said are “at very high risk” of having Ebola imported from an outbreak in eastern Congo.

The outbreak, which is concentrated in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces, is now the second biggest in history and has so far infected at least 450 people and killed at least 270 of them, WHO and Congo health officials said.

In South Sudan, teams of vaccinators have been trained by global health agencies and are now ready to conduct the Ebola vaccination plan, the WHO said in a statement. It is scheduled to start in the capital, Juba, on Dec. 19.

Ebola spreads among people through contact with bodily fluids. It causes hemorrhagic fever with severe vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding, and in outbreaks, more than half of cases are fatal.

The WHO said South Sudan was on “high alert” for the disease, but said no confirmed cases had as yet been detected there.

The experimental vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and made by Merck, targets the Zaire strain of the virus which is the one causing Congo’s current outbreak.

It is designed for use in a “ring vaccination” strategy, where contacts or known cases of Ebola are traced and immunized to halt the disease’s spread.

Just over 2,100 doses of rVSV-ZEBOV have been allocated to South Sudan and those vaccinated will be followed up and monitored for a minimum of 21 days, the WHO said.",no result found

Of the four new deaths recorded today, two are community deaths in Beni and Mabalako, which took place outside a hospital or Ebola treatment center, raising the risk of transmission, the DRC said.

There are also 80 people currently under investigation for suspected infections, the DRC's health ministry said in its daily update.

Unknown transmission chains

According to the latest weekly update from the World Health Organization's (WHO's) African regional office, among the 500 cases are 3 healthcare workers who have been infected since Dec 1. Since August, when the outbreak began, 49 healthcare workers have been infected, and 15 of those have died.

While vaccination and case contact tracing are under way, there are still unknown transmission chains in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, the WHO said. On Dec 8, for example, the agency said five new cases were identified, yet only two of the cases were known contacts.

""Contact tracing is still of concern due to insecurity and continuing pockets of community resistance. The number of contacts being followed as of 8 December 2018 was 6,417, of whom 5,812 had been seen in the previous 24 hours, representing 92%,"" the WHO regional office said.

As of today, the DRC said 44,447 people have been vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine. The WHO said the remaining stock of vaccine in Beni is 4,290 doses.

Katwa hospital burned

The WHO said Beni, Katwa and Kalunguta are the hot spots of the outbreak, representing 30%, 27%, and 17% of the 119 confirmed and probable cases reported from Nov 18 to Dec 8.

The WHO also said Komanda is an area of concern owing to surveillance challenges. The organization also said two healthcare posts and the Hope Health Centre in Katwa were burned by community members, another example of ongoing resistance in the volatile region.

""Particular challenges lie in investigating new confirmed cases without clear epidemiological links to other cases, the need to strengthen contact monitoring in Beni and Komanda and the need to intensify community engagement in Katwa. In addition, the potential implication of the upcoming elections bringing large numbers of people together remains an issue,"" the WHO said.

Difficulties with containment

On Twitter today, Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said new epidemiologic data illustrate the challenges of containing the outbreak.

""The epidemiological curve shows 2 phases. First centered in Mangina, largely controlled in a month. Second wave, more concerning, dispersed across many areas, has continued for over 2 months, with about 5 new cases per day,"" Salama tweeted.

In Beni, which has had more than 200 cases of Ebola, Salama said, ""[the] epi curve shows weekly incidence declining, but not over."" As cases in Beni fall, case counts are on the rise in Katwa and Butembo.

""We continually adapt our strategies to respond to each new challenge in this complex outbreak. Working with [the DRC ministry of health], partners, we will end this,"" Salama said.

Sick patient, traveling contacts trigger alerts

Officials also issued two health alerts about possible disease spread in Goma, the capital and largest city in North Kivu province. For weeks, officials have warned that Ebola could spread in the city.

The first alert came after a bleeding patient died at the Rutshuru General Referral Hospital in Goma, but subsequent tests showed the patient did not have Ebola.

The second alert came after six family members (three adults, three children) of a case contact in Beni left that city for Goma, avoiding the 21-day surveillance period for case contacts. Yesterday, all six people had been found and accounted for, and all have returned to Beni for the remainder of their surveillance period.

The DRC issued a warning to the citizens of Goma, highlighting the need for safe and dignified burials and best hygiene practices.

""If all the inhabitants of these cities respect the sanitary measures recommended by the Ministry of Health, it is possible to ensure that, even if an Ebola case arrives in the city, it would be a sporadic case [and] would not lead to a new outbreak,"" the DRC said.

Concern over many pediatric cases

In other news, UNICEF today raised concerns about the high number of children infected in the outbreak, the world's second largest.

According to UNICEF, one of every third person diagnosed in the current Ebola outbreak is a child, a uniquely high number. One in 10 children diagnosed with the virus are under the age of 5, and children are more likely to die from their infections than adults.

""We are deeply concerned by the growing number of children confirmed to have contracted Ebola,"" said UNICEF's Regional Director for West and Central Africa, Marie-Pierre Poirier, in a press release.

""The earlier children infected with Ebola receive treatment in a specialized health facility, the greater their chances of survival. Community mobilization and public awareness activities are also crucial to ensuring early detection and quick referral of suspected cases to Ebola treatment centres.""

Point-of-care test shows promise

Today in Science Translational Medicine, researchers published promising data on a new point-of-care test that can detect Ebola with 90.0% sensitivity and 97.9% specificity and malaria with 100.0% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity within 30 minutes.

The test uses surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) tags to simultaneously detect antigens from Ebola, Lassa, and malaria within a single blood sample, the study authors said, and could theoretically help clinicians differentiate between those viruses at the onset of a patient's symptoms. This is the first test to simultaneously detect these co-infections.

The test was assessed on 190 clinical samples collected from the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, along with 163 malaria positives and 233 negative controls.

The authors of the study said the new test, if developed, is preferable to current Ebola tests for outbreak use.

""Considering that diagnosis of infections such as Ebola come with heightened biosafety concerns, it is beneficial that the SERS assay requires only the addition of blood to a tube that is then closed and tested directly, with no need to reopen the test vial,"" they said. ""Its portability can enable near-patient testing, simplifying the logistics and biosecurity concerns associated with transporting samples for analysis.""

WHO official addresses vaccine supply

Finally today, Peter Salama, MD, the World Health Organization's (WHO's) deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said the organization was working with Merck to identify any possible supply chain gaps.

""WHO is working with the supplier of the investigational Ebola vaccine to address potential supply issues in DRC & elsewhere,"" Salama said on Twitter. ""We have not experienced a gap in the vaccine doses required. Supplier is actively working to increase availability of doses to meet evolving needs.""

Salama said 48,000 people have received the vaccine in response to the outbreak, including 2,000 healthcare workers in the DRC and Uganda. Health workers in South Sudan will also be vaccinated in the coming weeks, he added.

13-Dec-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is occurring in an unforgiving context. Non-engagement from communities and conflict continue to hamper response activities in some affected areas. Moreover, poor infection prevention and control (IPC) practices across numerous private and public health centers remain a major source of amplification of the outbreak and risk to health and other frontline workers.

Despite these challenges, substantial progress has been made on multiple fronts to address the situation, and daily successes are being observed in the implementation of proven public health measures alongside newer tools, such as vaccination and novel therapeutics. Together with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and our partners, WHO is further scaling up our response to the developing situation. WHO especially emphasizes the need to continuously improve quality, judiciously deploy new tools at our disposal, and sustain international commitment to response efforts well into 2019. Nonetheless, we remain confident the outbreak can be brought to a conclusion.

During the reporting period (5 through 11 December 2018), 37 new cases were reported from 10 health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces: Katwa and Butembo (18), Beni (seven), Mabalako (four), Oicha (three), as well as one case each in Komanda, Kyondo, Mandima, Musienene and Vuhovi. Four new infections of health workers have been reported in Musienene, Katwa and Butembo health zones. In total, 51 (49 confirmed and two probable) health workers have been infected to date, of whom 17 have died. Twenty-three additional survivors were discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) and reintegrated into their communities. A total of 177 patients have recovered to date.

As of 11 December, 505 EVD cases (457 confirmed and 48 probable), including 296 deaths, have been reported in 12 health zones in North Kivu Province and three health zones in Ituri Province (Figure 1). These zones represent a mix of densely populated urban areas and remote villages, each bringing a variety of factors driving transmission and posing different challenges. Trends in case incidence (Figure 2) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across these geographically dispersed areas, with an average of 33 new cases reported each week since mid-October. Although there has been a general decrease in the intensity of transmission in Beni in recent weeks, the outbreak is intensifying in Butembo and Katwa, and new clusters are emerging elsewhere. At present, the situation remains concerning.

The very high risk of further geographical spread of the outbreak was highlighted this week by the movement of several contacts of confirmed cases from Beni to Kisangani and Goma. All of these contacts were rapidly traced, and have since returned to Beni where they will complete their 21 day follow-up. Several alerts of potential cases were also received from Goma, and towns between Goma and Butembo. These individuals were promptly isolated, reported and tested negative for EVD. Preparedness and operational readiness activities in other areas of North Kivu and Ituri provinces, other provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and neighbouring counties, must continue to be upscaled to rapidly detect and respond to any potential cases.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. Infection prevention and control practices in health care facilities, especially antenatal clinics, need to be further strengthened.

For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO’s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advice against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Several areas affected

The 10 new cases push the overall outbreak total to 515 cases, 467 of them confirmed and 48 listed as probable.

According to today's update, the new cases are in Kyondo (4), Mabalako (2), Komanda (2), Kalunguta (1), and Beni (1).

Mabalako was one of the outbreak's early hot spots, and health officials have said they are worried about a resurgence of cases in it and other similar areas. The health ministry said today that a case-patient in Mabalako yesterday began having symptoms in his home near Biena, and investigators found that the individual contracted the virus from a patient in Aloya City in Mabalako health zone who died at an Ebola treatment center on Dec 3.

Seven more deaths were reported today, raising the fatality count to 303. The patients who died were from Kyondo, Katwa, Beni, Mabalako, and Komanda. All except the patient in Beni died in the community, a situation known to pose a high risk of disease spread.

Investigations continue into 96 suspected Ebola cases.

Youngest patient discharged

Meanwhile, the ministry said a baby born on Oct 31 to a mother with Ebola who died during childbirth is recovering after contracting the virus. The baby, the youngest known person to be infected in the outbreak, was admitted to a treatment center 6 days after birth and was discharged yesterday.

Doctors and other health workers took turns at the baby's bedside 24 hours a day to monitor treatment, the ministry said, adding that care-team nannies are Ebola survivors who can care for sick children while wearing lighter protective gear.

""They play a fundamental role in caring for sick children who need more attention and a reassuring presence at their side during treatment,"" the update said.

mAb114 licensing agreement

In other related Ebola developments, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, a biotechnology company based in Miami, today announced an agreement with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to license mAb114, an experimental treatment for Ebola.

The drug is a monoclonal antibody that is being used on an emergency, compassionate-use basis to treat Ebola patients in the DCR outbreak. In November, randomized controlled trials of mAb114 and other treatments launched in the country's outbreak region.

The company said in a press release today that mAb114 has already been through a phase 1 safety study, and preclinical studies in nonhuman primates suggested protection against Ebola with one-dose treatment.

In today's announcement, Ridgeback said the patent license agreement with NIAID covers intellectual property related to mAb114. Wendy Holman, the company's chief executive officer and cofounder, said, ""We are thrilled to have partnered with NIAID's Vaccine Research Center ('VRC') on mAb114 and will continue the incredible work that the VRC team has done.""

She said the company is grateful to the people and groups that have supported mAb114, as well as Ebola treatments and vaccines. ""Your efforts have been heroic and will continue to be essential in this fight against a disease which knows no boundaries,"" she added.

mAb114 was isolated from the blood of a patient who survived an Ebola infection in a 1995 outbreak in the city of Kikwit in the DRC. An NIAID VRC research team led by Nancy Sullivan, PhD, plus collaborators from the DRC, found that the patient still had Ebola antibodies against Ebola 11 years after infection. After isolating and testing the most favorable antibodies in lab and animal studies, they found that mAb114 was the most promising.

Today the DRC's health ministry reported six more cases, including three from Dec 12 in patients whose lab results were released late in the day.

Intensifying activity in Butembo, Katwa

The WHO said the infection control problems are occurring at several private and public health centers. The agency underscored the fact that Ebola virus spread in the clinic doesn't just affect patients, it's a threat to health workers, as well. Over the past week, four new infections were reported in healthcare workers, raising the total to 51, including 17 deaths.

The pace of new infections has averaged about 33 a week since the middle of October, and though there has been some decline in Beni—the main hot spot—the outbreak is intensifying in Butembo and Katwa, with new clusters popping up elsewhere. ""At present, the situation remains concerning,"" the WHO said, noting that affected health zones reflect a mix of densely populated urban areas and remote villages, resulting in different transmission patterns and response challenges.

A high risk of further spread was exemplified this week when several contacts from Beni traveled to Kisangani and Goma, the provincial capital. The WHO said health officials quickly found the contacts, who returned to Beni to complete their 21-day follow-up. Also, several alerts for suspected cases came from Goma and locations between Goma and Butembo, and responders quickly isolated the patients, all of whom tested negative for the virus.

Despite the tough challenges and conditions, the WHO said progress has been made on several fronts, with new tools such as vaccination and experimental treatments in use alongside proven tactics such as surveillance and rapid isolation.

Latest case details

The six new cases push the overall outbreak total to 521 cases, 473 of them confirmed and 48 listed as probable. Three of the newly infected patients are from Komanda, two from Beni, and one from Kalunguta.

Two more deaths were reported, one in Kalunguta and one in Komanda, and both occurred in the community, a factor that raises the risk of Ebola spread. The fatality count in the outbreak now stands at 306.

In vaccination developments, health officials began immunizing frontline providers in Goma health zone, where the recent alerts were issued, the health ministry said.

Also, a new vaccination ring opened in the South Mabanga district of Karisimbi health zone, located in Goma, targeting people identified as contacts of a group from Beni who had been identified as contacts but traveled to Goma.

So far, 46,047 people have been vaccinated since the campaign with Merck's experimental VSV-EBOV vaccine began on Aug 8.

A 'miracle' newborn baby survives Ebola in DRC An baby girl named Benedicte who contracted Ebola in DRC has survived her infection, with health workers calling her “the young miracle of Beni.” The little girl’s mother, a confirmed case of Ebola, died during childbirth on Oct. 31. Six days later, Benedicte was admitted to an Ebola treatment center in Beni, where she received around-the-clock care. The little girl’s discharge from the treatment center was an emotional moment for the people who cared for her, Jessica Ilunga, of the DRC Ministry of Health, told STAT. The fatality rate among children in this outbreak is upward of 70 percent, according to UNICEF. Kids under of 15 make up one-quarter of cases in this outbreak, which now stands at 515 cases and 303 deaths. ACA signups lag ahead of enrollment deadline Tomorrow marks the last day of open enrollment — and so far, the numbers suggest that sign-ups are lagging. As of Wednesday, nearly 20 percent fewer new people signed up for health insurance through ACA marketplaces than at the same time last year. Active renewals are also down 8 percent. It's not clear what, exactly, might be behind the lower enrollment numbers so far this year. But the low unemployment rate, the repeal of the individual mandate, less marketing spending, and Virginia's newly expanded Medicaid program could all play a role. Some caveats about the sign-up data: A few states have later deadlines and sign-ups can surge right before the deadline. More scientists are using female animals in their studies A growing number of scientists are using female animals in their research — but new research suggests the people who review grant applications aren't always taking inclusion into account. The NIH put a new policy in place in 2016 that's supposed to make sure scientists are including both male and female animals and cells in their preclinical studies. To see how that policy is playing out in the funding process, researchers polled NIH grant reviewers. The majority said they consider sex inclusion an important variable, but some said they didn't usually consider it when scoring a grant application. The authors say that points to a need for more awareness about the role sex plays in health and disease.

The baby’s mother, who had Ebola, died in childbirth, the ministry said.

The infant was discharged from the treatment center in Beni on Wednesday. “She went home in the arms of her father and her aunt,” the ministry said.

Experts have reported worryingly high numbers of children with Ebola in this outbreak, which Congo’s health ministry says now has 515 cases, 467 of them confirmed, including 255 confirmed deaths.

The tiny survivor is named Benedicte. In video footage shared by UNICEF, she is shown in an isolated treatment area, cradled in the arms of health workers in protective gear or cuddled by Ebola survivors, called “nounous,” who can go without certain gear such as masks. The survivors are crucial with their reassuring presence, the health ministry said.

“This is my first child,” her father, Thomas, says. “I truly don’t want to lose her. She is my hope.” He gazes at his daughter through the clear protective plastic.

Children now account for more than one-third of all cases in this outbreak, UNICEF said earlier this week. One in 10 Ebola cases is in a child under 5 years old, it said, and children who contract the hemorrhagic fever are at greater risk of dying than adults.

While Ebola typically infects adults, as they are most likely to be exposed to the lethal virus, children have been known in some instances to catch the disease when they act as caregivers.

Few cases of Ebola in babies have historically been reported, but experts suspect transmission might happen via breast milk or close contact with infected parents. Ebola is typically spread by infected bodily fluids.

The World Health Organization also has noted that health centers have been identified as a source of Ebola transmission in this outbreak, with injections of medications “a notable cause.”

So far, more than 400 children have been left orphaned or unaccompanied in this outbreak as patients can spend weeks in treatment centers, UNICEF said. A kindergarten has opened next to one treatment center in Beni “to assist the youngest children whose parents are isolated” there, it said.

Health experts have said this Ebola outbreak, the 10th in Congo, is like no other as they face the threat of attack from armed groups and resistance from a wary population in a region that had never faced an Ebola outbreak before. Tracking suspected contacts of Ebola victims remains a challenge in areas controlled by rebels.

In the past 3 days, new cases were recorded in Mabalako (4), Butembo (4), Katwa (5), Komanda (3), and 1 each in Oicha and Kalunguta.

On Dec 15, four of the five deaths recorded were classified as community deaths, which means they took place outside a healthcare or treatment center setting, and thus increase the risk of community transmission.

Vaccination efforts continue

Today the ministry of health said that vaccination efforts were still ongoing, and primary care providers in Goma, North Kivu's capital and largest city, were being vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine.

Since late August, 48,048 people have been vaccinated in the DRC, including 19,017 in Beni, 8,619 in Katwa, 5,077 in Mabalako, and 4,974 in Butembo.

Community outreach

Bishop Sikuli Paluku, the bishop of the Butembo-Beni diocese, launched the ""Family Without Ebola"" campaign throughout the district of Butembo-Beni, the ministry of health said on Dec 15.

Asking for youth engagement, the bishop said Catholics must act to protect themselves, their families, and neighbors from Ebola.

The bishop also referred to community resistance to health workers ""inhuman and cruel mischief,"" and warned against exhuming the graves of Ebola patients.

Today was also the final game in a football (soccer) tournament held in Beni, called ""Ebola Pas Chez Moi"" (Ebola not in my house). The activity was meant to educate local youth on the risk of Ebola transmission and the importance of cooperation with response workers.

""The coordination of the Ebola response organized this football tournament in Beni and Butembo in order to build trust with the youth of both cities,"" the ministry of health said.

""It was observed that young people were often the source of reluctance in the community and the first perpetrators of destruction of sanitary materials. The aim of the football tournament was to appease this youth, raise awareness about Ebola, and invite them to take ownership of the Ebola response to end the epidemic.""

Lassa fever confirmed in family cluster in Benin

In its weekly update, the World Health Organization's (WHO's) African regional office reported a Lassa fever outbreak in Benin among three members of a household.

The index case involved a 22-year-old-woman who contracted the disease while living and working in Kwara state, Nigeria, in late November. She moved back to Benin for medical treatment, and her husband and child also tested positive for the virus. All three patients are hospitalized and in good clinical condition.

According to the WHO, 33 contacts, including 24 healthcare professionals, 4 caregivers, and 4 patients, have been identified and are being monitored. Nigeria has been dealing with the world's largest-ever Lassa fever outbreak, with almost 600 confirmed cases.

""This event should be a wakeup call to the national authorities to step up preparedness measures for Lassa fever across the country, especially along the borders with Nigeria,"" the WHO said. ""Functional port health services and cross border surveillance is paramount, in light of the fact that the index case in this event crossed the border with symptoms. Improving routine universal precautions in healthcare settings is also critical, since about 70% of contacts during this event are health professionals.""

Yellow fever outbreak grows in Edo, Nigeria, to 97 suspected cases

Nigeria continues to battle a yellow fever outbreak in Edo state, which now stands at 97 suspected cases, including 23 deaths (case-fatality rate, 23.7%). Though the outbreak began in late September, more than half of the 97 cases were reported in the last 2 weeks, the WHO's regional office for Africa said in an update.

The WHO said about two thirds of suspected and confirmed cases come from Uhunmwonde, a rural farming community. Many residents of Uhunmwonde travel to the nearby state capital, Benin City, with a population of 1.5 million people.

Since September of 2017, Nigeria has recorded 3,510 yellow fever cases. Children ages 1 to 10 years account for 41% of cases, and males account for 58% of case-patients. Nigeria introduced the yellow fever vaccine into routine immunizations in 2016, but much of the population is still at risk for contracting the mosquito-borne virus

""In Edo State, yellow fever vaccination coverage in children below one year of age is about 69% and approximately 60% in the rest of the population, leaving a significant number of people susceptible to the disease,"" the WHO said.

In other yellow fever news, the WHO supplied more details on a Dutch man who contracted yellow fever while traveling in Gambia and Senegal in November. The 26-year-old man developed symptoms of yellow fever upon his return to the Netherlands, and was hospitalized on Nov 19. He remains hospitalized as of Dec 10 with acute liver failure.

The man was unvaccinated against yellow fever, and the WHO said the risk of local transmission of yellow fever in the Netherlands is negligible.

Lyme vaccine enters phase 2 trial; promising Powassan vaccine

Valneva, a French biotechnology company specializing in vaccine development, announced yesterday the start of a phase 2 clinical trial for its Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15.

The trial will help establish the optimal dosage level and schedule for use of the vaccine in 570 adult volunteers at study sites in the United States and Europe. The study centers will be located in places where Lyme is endemic, and subjects with a cleared past infection with Borrelia burgdorferi will also be enrolled.

VLA15, a protein subunit vaccine, is the only Lyme disease vaccine in development, and Valneva obtained fast-track designation by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) in July of 2017.

According to a press release from Valneva, ""It is designed for prophylactic, active immunization against Lyme disease aiming for protection against the majority of human pathogenic Borrelia species. VLA15 is designed to confer protection by raising antibodies that prevent Borrelia from migrating from ticks to humans after a bite.""

Also, a study today in Cell Reports shows that a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA vaccine against Powassan virus protected mice challenged with the deadly virus after one dose.

Powassan virus is a rare tick-borne flavivirus that can be fatal in humans. Researchers used a Zika vaccine platform to develop the vaccine, which showed cross-protection against Langat virus, as well.

Three of the new cases occurred in Katwa, two in Komanda, and two in Mabalako. Four of the seven new deaths were community deaths (two each in Katwa and Komanda), which raises the risk of transmission.

Three more healthcare workers infected

Also, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its latest situation report on the outbreak today, noting three additional infections in healthcare workers. The healthcare workers are from Mabalako, Kalunguta, and Musiene, and bring the total number of healthcare workers infected in this outbreak to 53. Eighteen of them have died.

Overall the case-fatality rate for this outbreak is 58%. In recent weeks, fewer cases have been reported in Beni, the epicenter of the outbreak throughout much of the past 5 months. But new hots spots have emerged, the WHO warned.

""The outbreak is intensifying in Butembo and Katwa, and new clusters are emerging elsewhere. Over the last 21 days (25 November to 16 December 2018), 120 confirmed and probable cases were reported from 14 health zones, the majority of which were reported from the major urban centres and towns in Katwa (27), Beni (27), Butembo (17), Komanda (16) and Mabalako (12),"" the WHO said.

The WHO also drew attention to a single case in Biena health zone, a newly affected area northwest of Butembo. The case was linked to recent cases in Mabalako, and the agency said the case highlights the risk of disease spread in the region.

Almost 50,000 vaccinated

The DRC said ring vaccination with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine continues, with 49,384 people vaccinated in the DRC, including 19,060 in Beni, 9,018 in Katwa, and 5,335 in Mabalako.

The vaccine also continues to be used among healthcare workers in Goma, the capital of North Kivu, the DRC health ministry said.

Most of the vaccine recipients are case contacts. The WHO has more than 30,000 contacts registered to date, and as of Dec 16, 6,430 remained under surveillance.

""The daily follow-up rate among listed contacts by health zones ranged from 90-93%"" from Dec 11 to Dec 16, the WHO said.

Health workers are also responding to an average of 149 alerts of suspected cases per day, of which 81 per day are validated as requiring further investigation.

Dec 19 DRC report

Dec 18 WHO situation report",no result found,no result found,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With an Ebola epidemic raging and millions caught in a forgotten “catastrophe” of conflict and hunger, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was the most neglected crisis of 2018, according to an annual Thomson Reuters Foundation poll of aid agencies.

This year’s survey was unusual for the high number of “most forgotten crises”, with experts also listing the Central African Republic, Lake Chad Basin, Yemen, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Burundi, Nigeria and, for the first time, Venezuela.

But Congo’s “mega-crisis” barely made headlines, they said, even as the country gears up for landmark elections on Sunday which some fear could stoke further unrest.

“The brutality of the conflict is shocking, the national and international neglect outrageous,” said Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council.

“I visited Congo this year and have seldom witnessed such a gap between needs and assistance.”

Congo, where 13 million people in a population of 82 million need help, also topped the annual Thomson Reuters Foundation poll in 2017, but agencies said the situation had deteriorated.

Six of 21 agencies polled named Congo as the most neglected crisis, including WFP, Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam, ActionAid, International Rescue Committee, and Christian Aid.

ActionAid’s humanitarian advisor Rachid Boumnijel urged the international community to redouble efforts to end years of conflict characterized by sexual brutality.

“It’s been a catastrophe for the country, and for women and girls particularly,” Boumnijel said.

EBOLA

Christian Aid’s head of humanitarian programs Maurice Onyango said the violence had caused “large-scale trauma”, with children witnessing parents and siblings being murdered.

An upsurge of fighting in the east of the mineral-rich country has also exacerbated the spread of the world’s second largest Ebola outbreak, agencies said.

The Central African Republic, where armed groups control much of the country and 60 percent of the population needs assistance, came a close second in the poll.

Listed as the most neglected by OCHA, UNICEF, MercyCorps, Plan International, and Caritas, the country has been racked by violence since mainly Muslim rebels ousted the president in 2013, provoking a backlash from Christian militias.

Armed groups are increasingly targeting schools, hospitals, mosques and churches, while attacks on aid workers have impacted a “chronically underfunded” humanitarian response, they said.

U.N. children’s agency UNICEF said thousands of children had been trapped in armed groups or subjected to sexual violence.

“The crisis is growing increasingly desperate and resources are at breaking point,” added UNICEF emergencies director Manuel Fontaine.

U.N. appeals for both DRC and CAR are less than 50 percent funded.

“Central African Republic is in a death spiral,” said Caritas Secretary General Michel Roy. “While governments and the world’s media have turned their backs, we must not. It’s the only hope CAR has left.”

Plan International said the media neglected complex crises like CAR and DRC because they lacked the shock factor of a sudden disaster like Indonesia’s huge earthquake in September.

“MASSIVE FLOOD”

Yemen, at risk of the world’s worst famine in 100 years, was highlighted by Muslim Hands and World Vision.

“With three quarters of the population needing assistance, I can’t see how Yemen isn’t at the top of everyone’s list,” said World Vision emergencies chief Mark Smith.

International Medical Corps warned the disaster in Lake Chad basin, where climate change and a prolonged insurgency by Boko Haram and Islamic State have left 11 million needing help, was also set to worsen next year.

Action Against Hunger said millions caught up in the “almost invisible” crisis - affecting Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon - faced poverty, hunger, sexual violence and child kidnapping.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the world’s biggest relief network, said hunger and disease following major flooding across Nigeria threatened to create a second protracted crisis in the country.

“I’m shocked by how little attention (this) has received. The figures are staggering,” said IFRC Secretary General Elhadj As Sy, adding that nearly 2 million people were impacted, more than 200,000 uprooted and swathes of cropland destroyed.

“This massive disaster has gone largely unnoticed by many donors and journalists,” he added.

This year was the first time Venezuela featured in the poll.

About 3.3 million people have fled political turmoil and economic meltdown in the Latin American country - many driven by hunger or violence - and another 2 million could follow next year, according to U.N. estimates.

The United Nations has launched a $738 million appeal to help nearby countries cope with what one U.N. official called a “humanitarian earthquake”.

CARE said evidence on the ground suggested the real number fleeing was far higher than the U.N. figure.

“Given its scale, it’s incredible how neglected the situation in Venezuela is,” said CARE humanitarian expert Tom Newby. “The world needs to wake up to this crisis.”

Afghanistan was ranked the most neglected crisis by Islamic Relief Worldwide, and South Sudan by Save the Children. The UNHCR named Burundi while mixed migration was highlighted by the Danish Refugee Council.",no result found
20-Dec-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

Responding to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be a complex challenge. Pockets of community reluctance and the conflict setting continue to obstruct activities in some affected areas. Additional challenges may also be anticipated during the ongoing election period, which may lead to heightened political tension, a deterioration of the overall security situation and violent civil unrest; presenting an indirect threat to the Ebola response operations.

Despite these difficulties, meaningful progress has been made across the outbreak affected areas, most especially in Beni where there has been a general decrease in case incidence in recent weeks. The control of the outbreak there, and previously in the city of Mangina, demonstrates how the outbreak can be controlled when response activities can be scaled and implemented with the participation of local communities. While the Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners work toward similar progress in Katwa, Butembo and other emerging clusters, we must acknowledge the unique challenges arising from each geographical area. The introduction, acceptance and resulting impact of interventions on the epidemiology of the outbreak will take time. Response teams continue to adapt and scale up the application of evidence-based public health measures and innovative tools.

Currently, the outbreak remains active across a geographically dispersed area covering fourteen health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Over the last 21 days (27 November – 18 December 2018), 114 new confirmed cases have been reported, from: Katwa (31), Beni (18), Komanda (17), Butembo (14), Mabalako (14), Kalunguta (5), Oicha (4), Vuhovi (3), Kyondo (3), Biena (1), Mandima (1), Masereka (1), Musienene (1), and Mutawanga (1). Only Tchomia Health Zone has not confirmed any new cases since the cluster was detected in mid-August. Amplification of the outbreak within these areas has been driven by a combination of social/community transmission and transmission within private and public health centres. In the past week, two new infections of health workers have been reported – 55 (53 confirmed and two probable) health workers have been infected to date, of whom 19 have died.

Cumulatively as of 18 December, 549 EVD cases (501 confirmed and 48 probable), including 326 deaths (case fatality ratio 59%), have been reported in 12 health zones in North Kivu Province and three health zones in Ituri Province (Figure 1). Overall trends in case incidence (Figure 2) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across these areas, with an average of 35 new cases reported each week since mid-October.

Small but meaningful victories continue to be won with the discharge of survivors from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs); aided by more timely admissions to ETC and use of Ebola therapeutics together with supportive care measures. In the past week, 18 additional patients were discharged from ETCs. Overall, 193 patients have recovered to date.

While all credible alerts outside of the abovementioned affected areas have tested negative for EVD to date, there remains a very high risk of further geographical spread within North Kivu and Ituri, to other provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to neighbouring countries. Preparedness and operational readiness activities across these areas must continue to be scaled-up to mitigate this risk, and rapidly detect and respond to any potential cases.

Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 18 December 2018 (n=549)*

*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning – trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. Infection prevention and control practices in health care facilities, especially antenatal clinics, need to be further strengthened.

For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO’s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advice against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) today in its latest snapshot of the epidemic said that, despite widespread continuing cases, activity is declining in Beni, which it sees as a promising development.

New cases in 5 locations

The 11 additional cases involve patients from five different locations: 7 from Komanda and 1 each from Katwa, Butembo, Kalunguta, and Beni. The latest infections lift the overall number of cases to 560, including 512 confirmed and 48 listed as probable.

Ten more deaths were reported, four them involving the delayed case reports from Komanda. The others include 3 in Beni, 2 in Butembo, and 1 in Komanda. Two of the deaths occurred in the community, a factor known to raise the risk of virus spread. So far, 336 fatalities have been reported in the outbreak.

The health ministry said officials are still investigating 87 suspected Ebola cases and that the number of people vaccinated since Aug 8 has reached 49,940.

Health minister visits outbreak region

In its update today, the ministry said DRC Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, PhD, made a 4-day visit to Beni, Goma, and Butembo this week to assess challenges for implementing the second phase of the response plan and to prepare for the third phase, which will cover February to April.

Today, Ilunga visited Beni, where new measures instituted in October have significantly reduced the number of cases. Only one new case has been reported in recent days in the city, which has been the main hot spot.

WHO: Cases continue over dispersed area

In an update today, the WHO said, despite ongoing community resistance and conflict obstacles, responders are making meaningful progress in the outbreak region, especially in Beni, where cases have declined in recent weeks.

Control of the outbreak there, and previously in Mangina, shows what can be achieved when response activities scale up and local communities participate. The WHO noted that the nature of the challenges varies in the latest emerging disease clusters. ""The introduction, acceptance, and resulting impact of interventions on the epidemiology of the outbreak will take time,"" it said.

Ebola transmission continues to occur over a dispersed area covering 14 health zones, and the only zone that hasn't had new confirmed cases since August is Tchomia. The WHO said the latest activity has been amplified by a combination of community transmission and transmission within local and private health centers.

Over the past week, two more infections were reported in healthcare workers, raising the total to 55, which includes 19 deaths, the WHO said.

Dec 20 DRC update

Dec 20 WHO update",no result found,no result found,"LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Doubts are growing about whether the world’s emergency stockpile of 300,000 Ebola vaccine doses is enough to control future epidemics as the deadly disease moves out of rural forest areas and into urban mega-cities.

FILE PHOTO: Healthcare workers carry the coffin of a baby believed to have died of Ebola, in Beni, North Kivu Province of Democratic Republic of Congo, December 15, 2018. REUTERS/Goran Tomasevic/File Photo

Outbreak response experts at the World Health Organization (WHO) and at the vaccines alliance GAVI are already talking to the leading Ebola vaccine manufacturer, Merck, to reassess just how much larger global stocks need to be.

“We’re actively engaged with the World Health Organization and with groups like GAVI, the U.S. government and others to try to understand what will be an appropriate sized stockpile in the future,” Merck’s head of vaccines clinical research, Beth-Ann Coller, said in a telephone interview.

Supply of the Merck shot, which is currently being used to fight a large and spreading outbreak of Ebola in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, is not a problem right now, according to the WHO’s deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response, Peter Salama.

But the nature of Ebola outbreaks is changing, he told Reuters. As the virus finds its way out of rural villages into populous urban settings, plans for how to contain it in future must change too.

“What I’m concerned about is the medium- to long-term stockpile. The figure of 300,000 was very much based on previous Ebola outbreaks where you never really had huge numbers of cases because they were in isolated, rural, populations. But now, we increasingly see Ebola in mega-cities and towns.”

“We need to view it now as an urban disease as well as a rural one - and therefore one requiring a different order of magnitude of preparations, including vaccines,” he said.

Merck’s experimental Ebola vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV, is the furthest ahead in development. Another potential vaccine being developed by Johnson & Johnson could also eventually become part of the stockpile, global health officials say.

Congo’s two Ebola outbreaks this year illustrate the shifting nature of the threat.

The first was relatively contained, infecting up to 54 people and killing 33 of them in an area of DRC’s Equateur Province that is remote and sparsely populated.

Several of the eight outbreaks before this one in Congo - including one in 2014 and another in 2017 both also in Equateur - were also quickly contained and limited in size.

But this year’s second outbreak in Congo - and the country’s tenth since the virus was first identified there in 1976 - is concentrated not in rural villages but in urban areas of the North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

It has already infected more than 450 people, killed more than 270, and last month spread to Butembo, a densely populated city of about one million.

This kind of prospect means global health emergency responders must “review our assumptions around Ebola”, Salama said. “If it were to take off in Butembo, or Goma, or, even worse, Kinshasa, we’d be talking about a totally different issue in terms of ... vaccine supplies required.”

Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI vaccines alliance which has an agreement with Merck to ensure a current stockpile of 300,000 rVSV-ZEBOV doses, told Reuters that around 40,000 doses had been used so far in the Congo outbreak.

The emergency response is based on “ring vaccination” which aims to control an outbreak by identifying and offering the vaccine to contacts of anyone likely to be infected. This method uses relatively small numbers of vaccine doses and forms a human buffer of immunity to try to prevent spread of the disease.

For now in Congo, Berkley said, there is no immediate need to boost the stockpile. But looking towards future inevitable outbreaks, the numbers would likely need to change.

“The challenge we would have - and this has been under discussion - is if we started to do community-based vaccination in urban and semi-urban areas. That’s when the numbers would start to get quite big quite quickly,” he told Reuters.

Merck’s shot has proven safe and effective in trials in West Africa but has yet to be approved for a license by U.S. and European regulators, so is being used in the Congo outbreak under special emergency rules for experimental products.

When it gets approval, which Coller hopes would be in 2019, it will be made at a newly built manufacturing plant in Germany.

Coller said Merck is not yet clear how many doses a year, or a month, the German facility could churn out once it is in production, but she stressed the company would “work collaboratively with the public health agencies to do our best to support their needs”.","Paul Molinaro is not looking forward to Christmas. He’s no Scrooge. But when you’re trying to keep an Ebola outbreak response up and running, the season of celebration and good cheer is a major inconvenience.

Rather than anticipating family gatherings, festive feasts, and brightly wrapped gifts, Molinaro, chief of operation support logistics for the World Health Organization’s emergencies program, dreads the likelihood of shops being closed, customs operations being understaffed, and pretty much everything he and his staff need to get done being that much more taxing over the Yuletide.

“Suppliers will tend to start shutting down for the holiday season. It becomes harder to get the windows of delivery because you may anticipate Kinshasa airport being a lot slower. It just becomes a pain for me,” said Molinaro, who is overseeing a team of several dozen logistical workers on the ground in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and at WHO headquarters in Geneva.

When we think of Ebola outbreak responses, chances are what comes to mind are courageous doctors and nurses caring for people afflicted by one of the cruelest and most deadly diseases known to man. What we tend to overlook is the mountain of work needed to ensure there is a treatment unit in which to care for the sick, and that there are boots and gloves and aprons and face shields to protect the medical staff.

Outbreak logisticians are the people who supply the response teams, who find them beds to fall into at the end of exhausting days, and food to sustain them and vehicles to transport them. It’s their job to create the conditions in which the people who know how to stop Ebola can get that essential task done.

When the right equipment is in the right place and in the right amounts, it “seems like magic,” Molinaro said. But in reality, it’s a lot of hard work.

Molinaro’s crew is supporting the upward of 300 people working for the WHO in northeastern Congo to extinguish this latest Ebola outbreak, which is now the second largest in history. As of Wednesday there have been 549 cases and 326 deaths since the outbreak began, likely in late April.

In addition to the WHO, there are several dozen international agencies and non-governmental organizations assisting the Congolese government in the battle to end this outbreak. They all need accommodations, meals, medical equipment, power generators, structures in which to care for the sick, vehicles in which to move from town to town, satellite phones or cellphone SIM cards, and more — much more.

The effort involved in sourcing all these necessities of work and life so that the Ebola responders can work on issues of life and death are divvied up among different partners in the response, Molinaro told STAT.

“Some of the partners, they have their own setup. It’s better like that; they know what they want in terms of their setup, the way they do their clinical management or care,” he said, noting this is especially true for the main medical NGOs that operate the Ebola treatment centers, ALIMA and Doctors Without Borders, which is known by the acronym for the French version of the name, MSF. “It’s definitely a team effort.”

Kim Comer, emergency logistics coordinator for MSF, was in DRC this week overseeing construction of a new treatment center in Katwa, a neighborhood in the large city of Butembo. Transmission of Ebola is picking up there, and a new treatment center is needed. The work involves everything from bulldozing the field to erecting fencing and hospital structures of wood and plastic sheeting, putting in latrines, installing generators to provide electricity, and myriad other things.

“If I could just work 20 more hours today, I could get my to-do list done,” said Comer, who is on her third Ebola outbreak. “But there’s just no way to get the list done.”

Case in point: The 27 staff bedrooms at the Katwa camp are already full, so more beds were being brought in, and people will have to double up.

ALIMA, which is operating a 61-bed Ebola treatment center in Beni, where the outbreak response is headquartered, goes through about 100 sets of personal protective equipment — PPE in infection control parlance — daily, ordered from Europe or North America, André Jincq, the organization’s emergency response logistics coordinator, said in an email. Ensuring that the critical supplies are always available requires careful advanced planning. Without this protective gear, treatment centers could not safely function.

Comer said MSF tracks the global stocks of coveralls to ensure the supplier is able to produce what aid workers need. The group has already stockpiled PPE supplies in Goma, a large city south the outbreak zone. There haven’t yet been cases in Goma, but there is concern the virus will make its way there, and the logisticians don’t want to be caught flatfooted.

“Your teams are telling you: XY is probably going to happen. We should increase A, B, C, and D to anticipate. We then go ahead and do that,” Molinaro explained. “And then when A, B, C, and D is needed, it seems like magic to the users that these things are just there. But these things arrived there after a process of discussion, really assessing the risk and then taking a call on whether we should forward something or not.”

This is Molinaro’s first Ebola outbreak. He joined WHO in mid-July and quickly “got thrown into it,” he said. (The outbreak was declared Aug. 1.) Prior to joining the WHO, he worked for the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund — UNICEF — in the Middle East. So he’s done this type of work before. But little else has the urgency of an Ebola outbreak, he said.

“Here we’re dealing with a situation if we’re not able to get a vaccination team in, equipped, and around the case and the contacts within a very short period of time — measured in hours — there’s potentially the chance … the virus moves on, infects, and kills people,” he said.

These days, most of the spread of Ebola is occurring in the cities of northeastern Congo, which is both a curse and a blessing. A curse because urban outbreaks are harder to extinguish. A blessing because it’s easier to meet some of the logistical needs than it would be in rural, difficult-to-access areas, suggested Yves Willemot, head of communications for UNICEF’s DRC country office.

Staff can be housed and fed in the hotels and restaurants of Beni, Butembo, and Goma, said Willemot — though he did acknowledge there is fierce competition for hotel beds.

“If you have 300 people from WHO and 50 from UNICEF, there’s a constant rotation of people coming in and people going out and rooms becoming available and new rooms being requested, etc. It’s a constant ‘fight’ to get rooms,” he said, supplying the air quotes. “And so the circumstances in which people are working and living are not necessarily always very easy.”

All those people need to get around. That means hiring vehicles, which can require some creativity, noted Molinaro, who said the WHO has a fleet of about 350 vehicles at its disposal now.

“Right at the beginning … it’s seeing a car come by and then asking, ‘Would you like to hire this [out]?’ And then word getting out and vehicle owners starting to present themselves and then you start going into a bit more of a process,” he said. “Inspecting the vehicle. Testing the driver. Coming up with a standard contract.”

The outbreak response has also been able to draw on the resources of a United Nations peacekeeping force, MONUSCO, which has been operating in the region for nearly two decades. About 40 of the vehicles at WHO’s disposal are MONUSCO vehicles on loan. They come equipped with radio communications — a “stroke of luck,” said Molinaro, given that it’s safer if a convoy of cars includes one with a radio.

The safety of outbreak response workers is an enormous concern in the region, where rebel forces have been known to kidnap and kill. On Monday, a World Food Program worker was killed in an ambush north of Goma.

Molinaro said the response teams are using a smartphone app developed by the International Organization for Migration that allows them to keep tabs on staff in the field. “It has a panic button. It has an ‘I’m OK’ button. ”

Because of the security concerns, there are actually two types of personnel protective equipment needed by outbreak staff. Molinaro calls them PPE-H (for health) and PPE-S (for security). The latter refers to Kevlar vests and helmets — not exactly standard attire in an Ebola outbreak.

One service that had been on Molinaro’s to-do list turned out to be too difficult to execute, even for a crew of people who get the impossible done. He’s not 100 percent sure how people working for the WHO are getting clean clothes.

“It’s something that we were trying to put into place. But it’s actually a lot of work. Because you have to identify whose laundry it is. You have to make sure when it’s done it’s all going back to that owner,” he said. “That in itself would be a logistics operation of remarkable precision…. Laundry really goes into micro-planning of ‘I don’t have two socks.'”

He’s curious about how the laundry dilemma has sorted itself out, but he suspects staff have found a local fix. “I think it ended up just kind of evolving through capitalism,” he said."

The Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) health ministry today reported three more cases and seven more deaths in the country's ongoing Ebola outbreak, as the number immunized topped 50,000.

In its daily update, officials said the 3 new lab-confirmed cases are from Beni, Komanda, and Oicha, bringing the outbreak total to 563 cases, including 515 confirmed and 48 classified as probable. Outbreak responders are still investigating 81 suspected Ebola cases.

Also, 7 new deaths were reported—2 in Beni, 2 in Butembo, and 1 each in Komanda, Oicha, and Mabalako. Three of the people died in a community setting, which raises the risk of further spread. So far, the virus has killed 343 people since the outbreak began in August.

The number of people immunized with Merck's unlicensed VSV-EBOV vaccine continues to grow, including primary healthcare workers in Goma, the provincial capital. According to today's report, 50,489 people have been vaccinated against Ebola in a campaign that began on Aug 8.

Dec 21 DRC update

Nigeria records one new vaccine-derived polio case

According to the latest weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), Nigeria recorded a new case of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), in Katsina state.

The case-patient had an onset of paralysis on Nov 5. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 in Nigeria has now reached 32.

""The country continues to be affected by two separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the first centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the second in Sokoto state,"" the GPEI said. ""Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.”

Last year Nigeria did not record any cases of polio. Nigeria, along with Afghanistan and Pakistan, is one of three countries in the world where polio transmission remains endemic.

""Health ministry workers have been engaged in the fight against Ebola in the affected areas. They have increased measures to limit transmissions like sanitation,"" Jessica Ilunga, health ministry spokeswoman, told Al Jazeera.

'A risk we have to take'

Many voters in the region told Al Jazeera the threat of the disease will not stop them from casting their ballot.

""We know Ebola is here but this is not an obstacle for us to go and vote on December 30,"" Kambale Kaputo, a civil servant in the city of Beni in North Kivu province, told Al Jazeera by phone.

""We have been sensitised to Ebola. We have been given measures to protect ourselves and this is helping. We always mingle in churches, at work and in markets. We will go and vote. It is a risk but we have to take it."" the 50-year-old added.

Christian Batenahe, a teacher from Beni, said nothing was going to stop him from heading to the polls.

""We are not worried at all. We are going to vote on December 30th because it is the right of every Congolese to go and vote. Ebola is not going to stop us,"" Batenahe said.

""Nobody is afraid of Ebola here in Beni. We know people are dying from that disease but those who remain have to vote for change to come to this country,"" the 33-year-old added.

Election delays

More than 46 million people have registered to take part in the long-delayed poll in the mineral-rich central African country.

Elections were first scheduled to take place in 2016 but were delayed because the electoral body said it did not have the resources to hold the vote.

On Thursday, CENI postponed the vote until December 30 following a fire that destroyed voting machines at one of its main warehouses in the capital, Kinshasa.

The blaze destroyed nearly 80 percent of the 10,000 voting machines meant for the city, which is home to about 15 percent of the country's electorate. Officials also cited the Ebola outbreak in its delay of the election.

The tightly-contested election is meant to choose a successor to President Joseph Kabila, who is due to step down after 18 years in power.

Twenty-one candidates are competing for the country's top job.

Ilunga visited Butembo first, then toured an Ebola treatment unit under construction in Katwa Health District before wrapping up his day by surprising the team in Beni by showing up at their daily meeting.

He praised Ebola workers across the country and around the world who are working over the holidays on the outbreak response. ""For this commitment and sacrifice, the Minister of Health said that they deserve the respect and recognition of an entire nation,"" the ministry said yesterday in its daily update.

New cases span several locations

Of the 22 new cases are from eight different locations: Katwa (7), Mabalako (3), Beni (3), Butembo (3), Kalunguta (2), Oicha (2), Musienene (1), and Komanda (1), according to separate daily reports between Dec 22 and today from the DRC's health ministry. The new cases boost the outbreak total to 585 cases, which includes 537 confirmed infections and 48 listed as probable.

Also, officials reported 13 more deaths, raising the overall outbreak fatality count to 356. Six of the latest deaths occurred in community settings, a factor that raises the risk of spread, given that the sick people weren't isolated in Ebola treatment units and that viral levels are at their highest when patients are severely ill.

As of today, health officials are still investigating 74 suspected Ebola cases.

The World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said yesterday in its weekly outbreak and health emergencies report that Katwa, Komanda, Beni, Butembo, and Mabalako are the main hot spots.

Newly affected zone, voting delay for some

It added that a previously reported death of a patient in Komanda has been reclassified to the newly affected health zone of Nyankunde in Ituri province. Response activities need to be intensified in the Nyankunde area with the emergence of a new confirmed case in the area, the WHO noted.

New confirmed cases continue to be reported that don't have clear epidemiological links to other cases, which is especially challenging the WHO said.

The upcoming general election is slated for Dec 30, and the WHO said large gatherings related to that in the outbreak region could pose a risk of further Ebola spread.

However, the already-postponed election will be postponed in certain communities where Ebola infections have been reported, the Associated Press reported today. The announcement today by the country's electoral commission could stir further unrest, given that the opposition party criticisms that the move will hurt their chances at the polls.

According to the AP story, areas in and around Beni and Butembo in North Kivu province and Yumbi in Mai-Ndombe province will vote in March, long after the results announcement on Jan 15 and the inauguration of a new president 3 days later.

Vaccination ring to open in Kinshasa

The number of people vaccinated since Aug 8 has now reached 53,031, the health ministry said today.

In a recent development, the WHO's African regional office said in its weekly report yesterday that a new vaccination ring will be opened in Kinshasa, the country's capital, surrounding a contact from Katwa health zone.

Dec 26 AP story",no result found,no result found,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - Voters in three Congolese cities known as opposition strongholds will be excluded from presidential elections on security and health grounds, officials said, in a move that looks certain to inflame political tensions before Sunday’s ballot.

The national electoral commission (CENI) said an Ebola outbreak - the second-worst in history - was behind the postponement of voting until March in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo cities of Beni and Butembo and surrounding areas. It cited ethnic violence for the same delay in the western city of Yumbi.

The election is meant to lead to the first democratic transfer of power in DRC, Africa’s leading copper producer and whose conflicts have in the past destabilized the entire central part of the continent.

Kizito Bin Hangi, the president of civil society groups in Beni, told Reuters the state-controlled CENI’s decision was unjustified and that residents would start protests on Thursday to demand the vote go ahead there.

Leading opposition candidate Martin Fayulu had earlier on Wednesday warned the CENI against any move to shelve voting in Beni and Butembo. “The pretext of Ebola is fallacious because there has been campaigning in these areas. It’s yet another strategy to hijack the truth of the polls,” he tweeted.

Paul Tshilumbu, a spokesman for the UDPS party of the other main opposition candidate, Felix Tshisekedi, told Reuters Tshisekedi would participate in Sunday’s vote despite the CENI’s announcement.

REPEATEDLY POSTPONED

The elections - also incorporating legislative and provincial polls - were originally meant to take place in 2016. They have been repeatedly postponed since then, sparking violence in which security forces have killed dozens of people.

The CENI pushed the election date back by seven more days last week due to delays deploying voting materials.

Explaining the three exclusions, it said on Wednesday: “Elections lead to important movements of voters toward polling places, thus leading to concentrations of people ... raising the risk of propagation of this disease and providing the conditions for terrorist attacks.”

Voting elsewhere in the vast central African nation would go ahead on Sunday as planned. Final results for the presidential vote would be announced on Jan. 15, with the new president sworn in on Jan. 18, the CENI said.

It did not explain how votes in Beni, Butembo and Yumbi would be accounted for in the result.

The three cities, which account for more than 1.2 million of Congo’s roughly 40 million registered voters, are known as bastions of opposition to outgoing President Joseph Kabila, who is supporting his former interior minister, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, in the race.

Longtime President Kabila, 47, has governed since his father’s assassination in 2001. He won elections in 2006 and 2011, although the latter was marred by widespread accusations of fraud.

In its daily update today, the DRC health ministry said protests in Beni and Butembo severely disrupted the Ebola response, hampering vaccination, safe burials, and lab functions in Beni, and the usual volume of follow-up on health alerts.

Vandals damage facilities in Beni

According to a CNN report today, police fired tear gas to break up protestors who blocked roads and burned tires in Beni, a day following an announcement from the country's election commission that voting in the long-delayed general election will be pushed from Dec 30 to March in three cities, including Beni and Butembo in North Kivu's outbreak area.

On Twitter today the health ministry said demonstrators vandalized facilities inside the transit center in Beni where 24 patients with suspected infections were under evaluation. It said the damaged unit is separate from the Ebola treatment center (ECT) where patients with confirmed illnesses are treated.

The ministry said it is still evaluating the extent of damage at the transit center and that demonstrators also stole chairs and tables from the location. In addition, demonstrators partially burned tents housing safe burial teams.

Of the 24 patients at the transit center, 3 were in serious condition and have been transferred to the ETC to wait for their test results. Of the other 21, 17 had already tested negative on their first tests and were waiting to take their second test and 4 were waiting for the results of the first test.

The ministry said medical teams are in contact the families of patients who fled the transit center and that a temporary structure will be built to take care of them and to isolate newly suspected case-patients in Beni.

In its regular daily update, the health ministry said 11 patients returned later in the afternoon and were placed in extra tents at the ETC.

""Although these patients are still traumatized by the events that occurred in the morning, they came back because they understand that a fast and adequate care will increase their chance of survival if they prove to be contaminated by the Ebola virus,"" the health ministry said.

Six newly confirmed cases

In other outbreak developments, the health ministry today reported six more cases from four locations: Kalunguta (2), Oicha (2), Beni (1), and Komanda (1). The new illnesses lift the overall outbreak total to 591, which includes 543 confirmed cases and 48 classified as probable.

Health officials are still investigating 12 suspected Ebola cases; however, the health ministry noted that protests severely limited surveillance operations and very few alerts could be investigated in Beni and Butembo.

One more death was reported, involving a person from Beni who died in the community. The death puts the number of fatalities at 357.

The centre housed patients suspected of having the deadly viral disease before the confirmed cases are transferred to an isolation centre.

""The protesters have attacked the Ebola centre in the town. This is serious because the epidemic can spread,"" Matthieu Kamble, a resident, told Al Jazeera by telephone.

181224090825920

The demonstrators were unhappy with the electoral commission (CENI) after it delayed Sunday's election in three DRC cities.

On Wednesday, CENI said voting in Beni and Butembo in the eastern North Kivu province and Yumbi in western Bandundu province will take place in March next year instead.

The commission said it delayed the poll in North Kivu because of the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the region, the second-worst in history.

The latest outbreak, which started in May 2018, has left more than 320 people dead.

'We have to vote'

""The electoral commission is responsible for what's happening. We don't accept the delay, we have to vote,"" Kambale said.

Another resident, Justin Safari, said the situation in the city will not change unless people are allowed to cast their ballot.

""Delaying over the Ebola outbreak is not good enough a reason. They can't use it to leave us behind while other Congolese vote on Sunday. It doesn't make any sense,"" Safari said.

Residents in Beni told Al Jazeera that security forces used tear gas and fired in the air to disperse protesters, who burned tires and blocked roads to express anger at their exclusion from the polls.

""Protesters blocked the main road and destroyed the Ebola centre. They are chasing the volunteers fighting the disease. Nobody wants to accept an election delay here,"" Kizito Bin Hangi, president of Beni Civil Society, told Al Jazeera.

The DRC was scheduled to have its election in 2016, but the electoral body kept delaying, citing a lack of resources to hold the polls in the vast country which is roughly five times the size of France.

CENI scheduled the vote for December 23, but that again was extended by a week after voting machines were destroyed in a fire at the electoral body's main warehouse in the capital, Kinshasa.

More than 46 million Congolese are registered to take part in the polls.

28-Dec-18,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to respond to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While communities in affected areas are generally supportive of the Ebola response, operations in some areas have been temporarily disrupted due to insecurity. On 27 December 2018, protests at government buildings in Beni spilled over to an Ebola transit centre, frightening people waiting for Ebola test results and the staff who were caring for them. Staff at the centre temporarily withdrew and most suspected cases were transferred to a nearby treatment centre. WHO is concerned about the negative effects that the current insecurity is having on efforts to control the outbreak. After an intensification of field activities, marked improvements in controlling the outbreak were observed in many areas, including a recent decrease in cases in Beni. These gains could be lost if we suffer a period of prolonged insecurity that results in increased Ebola virus transmission. While maintaining focus on ending the outbreak and resuming normal operations as soon as possible, all response partners remain committed to ensuring the safety of staff. WHO continues to monitor the situation closely and will adapt their response as needed.

As of 26 December 2018, a total of 591 EVD cases, including 543 confirmed and 48 probable cases, have been reported from 16 health zones in the two neighbouring provinces of North Kivu and Ituri (Figure 1). Of these cases, 54 were healthcare workers, of which 18 died. Overall, 357 cases have died (case fatality ratio 60%). In the past week, ten additional patients were discharged from Ebola treatment centres; overall, 203 patients have recovered to date. The highest number of cases were from age group 15‒49 years with 60% (355/589) of the cases, and of those, 228 were female. Highest attack rates have been observed in children aged more than one year (especially male infants) and females aged 15 years and older.

Trends in case incidence (Figure 2) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across these geographically dispersed areas. The general decrease in the weekly incidence observed in Beni since late October continued; however, the outbreak is intensifying in Butembo and Katwa, and new clusters have emerged in other health zones. Thirteen health zones reported a total of 109 confirmed cases in the last 21 days (5‒26 December 2018). The majority of which were concentrated in major urban centres and towns in Katwa (26), Komanda (21), Mabalako (15), Beni (14) and Butembo (10) health zones. An isolated case was also recently detected in Nyankunde Health Zone – a newly affected area in Ituri Province – whom likely acquired the infection in Komanda. This case, highlights the continued high risk of continued spread of the outbreak and the need to strengthen all aspects of the response in Ituri, North Kivu and surrounding provinces and countries.

The MoH, WHO and partners continue to monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as in Uganda. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside of the abovementioned outbreak affected areas.

Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 26 December 2018 (n=591)*

*Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning – trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. Infection prevention and control practices in health care facilities, especially antenatal clinics, need to be further strengthened.

For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO’s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advice against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

In a statement today, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said the WHO and its partners are continuing their work, despite a deteriorating security situation that temporarily disrupted or slowed response actions such as vaccination and contact tracing in Beni and Butembo.

The DRC's health ministry said in its daily update today that response activities in Beni and Butembo were severely affected for the second day following protests. And in a separate report detailing the latest outbreak trends, the WHO said cases continue across a geographically dispersed area, and although Ebola infection numbers continue to decline in Beni, the outbreak is intensifying in Butembo and Katwa, with new clusters popping up elsewhere.

Officials address security concerns

""We have reached a critical point in the Ebola response,"" Tedros said, noting a recent decline in cases in Beni after field activities were intensified.

""These gains could be lost if we suffer a period of prolonged insecurity, resulting in increased transmission. That would be a tragedy for the local population, who have already suffered too much,"" he said.

Teams in Beni and Butembo are adapting to the situation, despite the security challenges, Tedros said. For example, in Beni, contact tracing has been resumed with the help of local community relays.

In general, communities in Ebola-affected areas have supported the response, he said. ""We ask for everyone to protect health facilities and provide access for responders to the affected populations so that we can stop this outbreak.""

The DRC's health ministry also addressed the vandalism that occurred yesterday, which it said also affected Beni's public and private health centers.

""Although the Ministry respects the right to protest by the population, this right can not be used as an excuse to attack health facilities and health workers,"" the ministry said. ""In addition to being a crime, these serious acts unnecessarily expose the entire community to a greater spread of the Ebola outbreak.""

Two new cases today

The DRC's health ministry today reported two new confirmed cases, both from Katwa. The new development lifts the overall outbreak total to 593, which includes 545 confirmed and 48 probable illnesses.

Two more deaths were reported, one from Mabalako and the other from Beni. So far, 359 people have died from their Ebola infections.

Health officials are investigating 66 suspected cases, but the ministry added that monitoring activities by teams in Beni and Butembo were severely limited today following yesterday's protests and that responders could handle very few alerts.

Vaccination was on hold in Beni, Butembo, Katwa, and Mabalako health zones.

The damaged transit center in Beni--where suspected case-patients are tested-- isn't operating, but Ebola treatment centers in Beni and Butembo are open, but with fewer health workers.

Another health worker infected

In its weekly update on the outbreak, the WHO said that, over the past 3 weeks, cases have been concentrated in Katwa, Komanda, Mabalako, Beni, and Butembo. However, it noted that a case was recently reported in Nyankunde, a newly affected area in neighboring Ituri province. The case involves a person who probably contracted the virus in Komanda.

""This case, highlights the continued high risk of continued spread of the outbreak and the need to strengthen all aspects of the response in Ituri, North Kivu and surrounding provinces and countries,"" the WHO said.

According to the report, one more infection was reported in a health worker, raising the total to 54, including 18 deaths.

People ages 15 to 49 make up 60% of patients. And of the 355 cases spanning those ages, 228 (64%) involve females. The WHO noted that the highest attack rates are in children older than 1 year, especially boys, and girls and women age 15 and older.

Protesters angry with the postponement of Sunday's presidential election in parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo rallied for a second day on Friday as President Joseph Kabila blamed a deadly Ebola outbreak for the last-minute decision.

ADVERTISING Read more

Congolese authorities have cited the Ebola outbreak as one of the reasons behind the postponement, which will affect an estimated 1 million voters, with Kabila claiming it would be a ""disaster"" if someone infects scores or hundreds of others.

This latest delay in an election meant to occur in late 2016 has angered both residents and the opposition, which accuses the government of trying to ensure that Kabila's preferred successor is elected.

Protests broke out in the city of Beni, where hundreds of people demanded the right to vote on Sunday with the rest of the country. Police and the army used live ammunition and tear gas to disperse the marchers who barricaded streets.

Some protesters carried crosses displaying ""RIP Kabila"" and saying his preferred successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, ""will never be our president"".

Observers say DR Congo 'ill-prepared' for Sunday's election

The latest protests come a day after demonstrators attacked an Ebola response centre in Beni and sent 21 patients fleeing. While the health ministry said most had tested negative for the virus and 11 people had already returned, the vandalism was the latest setback in efforts to contain an outbreak that has already killed more than 350 people.

The uproar over the voting delay has ""badly disturbed"" Ebola response work in Beni and Butembo, Congo's health ministry said. Health teams could barely deploy on Thursday and no Ebola vaccinations could be carried out, it said.

The Oxfam aid organisation said it was forced to suspend its Ebola response work. Acting country director Raphael Mbuyi called the situation ""extremely worrying"" because previous suspensions have led to a spike in new cases.

Mbuyi added, however, ""it's not surprising that people who have had their votes taken away at the last minute are frustrated and going to the streets. These people deserve to have their say as well.""

Kabila defiant

In an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday, Kabila contradicted his own health officials and experts with the World Health Organisation, who have said precautions were taken in collaboration with electoral authorities so people could vote.

Kabila claimed Ebola could spread as people use voting machines, which require tapping on a touchscreen to select candidates. A polling station could have 500 to 600 voters and ""this assumes that a lot of people will be contaminated"", he said.

Health officials have said voters would sanitise their hands before and after voting.

Until this week, the Ebola outbreak declared on August 1 had been a challenge but not a barrier to the election. Voting is now delayed in the cities of Beni and Butembo – but not in other communities with confirmed Ebola cases – until March, long after the inauguration of Kabila's successor in January.

There is ""no further reason"" to prevent Sunday's election, Kabila told the AP, adding: ""Rest assured, there will be peace."" Police will be there to secure the population, he said.

He dismissed opposition allegations that campaigns had faced restrictions, including blocked flights and assaults on supporters, in recent weeks.

Congo's leader also sounded defiant in the face of international pressure, days after his government ordered the European Union ambassador to leave the country within 48 hours, citing EU sanctions on Kabila's preferred successor, Shadary.

The former interior minister is under an EU asset freeze and travel ban for obstructing Congo's electoral process and for a crackdown against protesters angry over the delayed vote. The EU prolonged the sanctions this month.

Kabila, when asked what advice he had for his successor, replied: ""The biggest recommendation is that he listen to the voice of the Congolese and not follow that of the United States, Europe or elsewhere.""

Congo has resisted what it considers international meddling, vowing to fund the election itself. Western observer groups are notably absent.

(FRANCE 24 with AP)","GENEVA (Reuters) - Progress in fighting Democratic Republic of Congo’s Ebola outbreak, the second worst ever, will be reversed if fighting continues around the disease hotspots of Beni and Butembo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday.

“We have reached a critical point in the Ebola response,” WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. “After an intensification of field activities, we were seeing hopeful signs in many areas, including a recent decrease in cases in Beni.

“These gains could be lost if we suffer a period of prolonged insecurity, resulting in increased transmission. That would be a tragedy for the local population, who have already suffered too much.”

The disease has killed 356 of the 585 people infected during the almost six-month outbreak, and one-fifth of the cases have occurred within the past three weeks, according to a weekly update from WHO.

The epidemic in a volatile part of Democratic Republic of Congo is now only surpassed by the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa, where more than 28,000 cases were confirmed.

Congo has suffered 10 Ebola outbreaks since the virus was discovered there in 1976. It spreads through contact with bodily fluids and causes haemorrhagic fever with severe vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding.

On Thursday, Congo’s Health Ministry said 24 patients fled an Ebola treatment center in Beni when it came under attack by people protesting the cancellation of voting in the eastern city in Sunday’s presidential election.

“Protests at government buildings in Beni spilled over to an Ebola transit center, frightening people waiting for Ebola test results and the staff who were caring for them. Staff at the center temporarily withdrew and most suspected cases were transferred to a nearby treatment center,” Tedros said.

Health teams in Beni were prevented from carrying out critical field work, including vaccinations, tracing of potential Ebola carriers, and following up on alerts of potential new cases.

The medic, who is not exhibiting symptoms of Ebola, will remain under observation for up to two weeks at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) in Omaha, Nebraska Medicine said in a statement.

The individual’s name was not released for privacy reasons.

Symptoms such as fever and abdominal pain may appear up to three weeks after contact with the deadly virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Should symptoms develop, the healthcare worker would be moved to the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit, one of only a few in the United States for treating infectious diseases.

The Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo is the second worst ever and has killed 356 of the 585 people infected since it began six months ago, according to the World Health Organization.

Nebraska Medicine, a network of hospitals, clinics and healthcare colleges, together with academic partner UNMC, are among world leaders in the treatment of Ebola, which spreads through contact with bodily fluids and causes hemorrhagic fever with severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding.

Nebraska Medicine cared for three patients with the virus in 2014 and monitored several others for exposure during a 2013-16 outbreak in West Africa that was the worst on record, with more than 28,000 cases confirmed.","A health worker in protective gear works at an Ebola treatment center in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

An American health worker who has been caring for patients infected with Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was flown back to the United States after having what is described as “a possible exposure” to an Ebola patient.

The person was flown by charter flight to Omaha and admitted for observation to Nebraska Medical Center. The center has a special containment unit in which it can care for people with dangerous infectious diseases.

The person isn’t displaying symptoms of Ebola, the center said in a statement. But the medical evacuation ensures quick access to specialized care if symptoms develop.

“This person may have been exposed to the virus but is not ill and is not contagious,” Dr. Ted Cieslak, an infectious diseases specialist, said in the statement from Nebraska Medicine.

The hospital has access to experimental Ebola therapies that it could use to treat the person if he or she becomes ill, spokesman Taylor Wilson told STAT.

The health worker’s identity has not been disclosed — though Politico reported he is a 39-year-old male doctor — nor has information been released about how he or she was possibly exposed to the deadly virus, and when.

The incubation period for Ebola is two to 21 days, with most people who develop the disease showing symptoms within eight to 10 days. The statement from Nebraska Medical said monitoring could last up to two weeks, which suggests several days may have passed since the exposure event.

The individual was vaccinated with an experimental vaccine the day after the exposure event, a person familiar with the situation, who was not authorized to speak about it and requested anonymity, confirmed to STAT. The vaccine, being developed by Merck, is being used to combat the outbreak.

So far in this outbreak, 54 health workers have been infected with Ebola and 18 have died, according to the World Health Organization.

The statement said the individual had asked for privacy and the request would be honored.

The individual is likely someone working with one of the medical charities caring for Ebola patients in the outbreak zone. U.S. government employees have been barred from working on the ground in this outbreak, because of security concerns. Consequently, no one from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the United States Agency for International Development — USAID — have been working in the outbreak zone in northeastern Congo since late August.

That part of the Congo has been experiencing high levels of unrest and violence that have hampered the Ebola containment efforts for months.

But the violence reached a new level this week after it was announced that the area would not take part in national elections being held Sunday. Voting in the region has been postponed until March, which means the voters will not have a voice in the election of the country’s next president. The outcome of the presidential election will be declared in mid-January.

Last week, the resulting anger was directed at the Ebola response efforts. A mob attacked a facility at Beni built to house people who were waiting for the results of Ebola tests. Since then, a number of non-governmental organizations, including Doctors Without Borders, have moved some international staff from the area.

The outbreak, which is believed to have begun in late April, is the second largest on record. To date, there have been nearly 600 confirmed and probable cases reported and nearly 360 deaths, and there are fears the current violence could drive up those numbers sharply.

Nebraska Medical Center looked after three patients with Ebola who were brought back to the United States for care during the West African Ebola outbreak in 2014 and 2015. Two of the three recovered, but one, who had been ill for more than a week before he was evacuated from Sierra Leone, died two days after arriving in Nebraska.

Scores of polling centres had not yet opened even hours after Congo's presidential election officially began, the electoral commission chief confirmed Sunday, as voters shouted ""We wanted to vote!"" and frustrated people walked away.

Millions of Congolese electors are choosing a successor to President Joseph Kabila, who is stepping down two years after his term limit expired – a delay that sparked bloody clashes and revived traumatic memories of past turmoil.

The vote gives DR Congo the chance of seeing its first peaceful transfer of power since it gained independence from Belgium in 1960.

But analysts say the threat of violence is great, given the many organisational problems and wide-ranging suspicion of Kabila.

The election's credibility has already been strained by repeated delays, the risk of hitches on polling day and accusations that electronic voting machines will produce a rigged result.

Delays blight DR Congo's elections

On the eve of the vote, talks between key candidates to avert post-election violence broke down.

Opposition front-runners Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi refused Saturday to sign a proposed peace pledge, saying election officials had failed to make suggested changes to the text.

The announcement came after the pair had met with the Independent National Election Commission (CENI) as well as Kabila's preferred successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary.

The UN, the United States and Europe have loudly appealed for the elections to be free, fair and peaceful – a call echoed on Wednesday by the presidents of Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and the neighbouring Republic of Congo.

Opposition chance?

Polling stations opened in the east of the country a little after their scheduled time of 4am (GMT) and an hour later in Kinshasa and the west, with electoral officials and observers the first to cast their ballots in Lubumbashi.

""I'm excited to vote, to be able to choose at last,"" one 18-year-old student named Rachel told AFP.

In one polling station, electoral officials were still adjusting voting machines and in another a technician needed to restart a machine that had broken down, an AFP reporter saw.

The last polling stations are due to close at 4pm (GMT).

Twenty-one candidates are standing in the presidential election, which is taking place simultaneously with ballots for the national legislature and municipal bodies.

Contenders include Kabila's champion Shadary, a hardline former interior minister facing EU sanctions for a crackdown on protesters.

His biggest rivals are Fayulu, until recently a little-known legislator and former oil executive, and Tshisekedi, head of veteran opposition party the UDPS.

If the elections are ""free and fair"" an opposition candidate will likely win, according to Jason Stearns of the Congo Research Group, based at the Center on International Cooperation at New York University.

However, ""the potential for violence is extremely high"", Stearns warned.

Between 43 and 63 percent of respondents said they would not accept the results if Shadary is declared the winner, he said. And between 43 percent and 53 percent said they did not trust DRC's courts to settle any election dispute fairly.

However, Kabila said he was confident ""everything will go well on Sunday"".

""I want to reassure our people that measures have been taken with the government to guarantee the safety of all sides, candidates, voters and observers alike,"" he said in his end-of-year address broadcast Saturday.

A closer look at Kabila's long tenure in power

Frail giant

Eighty times the size of its former colonial master Belgium, the DRC covers 2.3 million square kilometres (920,000 square miles) in the middle of Africa, behind only Algeria in area on the continent.

Gold, uranium, copper, cobalt and other riches are extracted from its soil, but little of that wealth trickles down to the poor.

In the last 22 years the country has twice been a battleground, drawing in armies from around central and southern Africa.

>> Resource-rich DR Congo, wracked by political instability and violence

The legacy of that era endures today in the DRC's eastern border region, where ruthless militias have carried out hundreds of rapes and killings.

Insecurity and an ongoing Ebola epidemic in part of North Kivu province, and communal violence in Yumbi in the southwest of the country, prompted the authorities to postpone the elections in those areas until March – long after the provisional results are due on January 6.

Kabila said the vote would take place ""as soon as the situation allows it"", but legal experts say the postponement is unconstitutional.

Around 1.25 million people out of an electoral roll of 40 million are affected by the delay.

No explanation has been offered as to how delaying the vote will affect the official outcome.

Monitoring in Nebraska

""An American providing medical assistance in the Democratic Republic of Congo recently experienced a possible exposure to the Ebola virus and is in Omaha for monitoring,"" the Nebraska Medical Center said in a Dec 29 news release.

The health worker has no symptoms, the medical center said. If symptoms begin, the patient will be housed in the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit at the center, which was established to treat people who have serious, high-risk diseases.

""This person may have been exposed to the virus but is not ill and is not contagious,"" said Ted Cieslak MD, infectious diseases specialist with Nebraska Medicine and associate professor of epidemiology in the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health.

The healthcare worker was transported by automobile and private plane to Nebraska. Monitoring could last 2 weeks, but Nebraska Medical Center said it would not provide updates ""unless the need arises"" or if the person is transferred to the biocontainment unit.

Staff at the unit treated three patients who had Ebola in 2014 during West Africa's outbreak, including one who died. The center monitored several others in 2015 who never developed the disease.

Politico identified the person as a 39-year-old physician.

Five new DRC cases amid violence

Yesterday and today the DRC health ministry reported 5 new Ebola cases, 2 in Butembo and 1 each in Oicha, Komanda, and Mabalako. They bring the outbreak total to 598 cases, 548 of which have been confirmed.

Four new deaths were also confirmed Dec 29 through today, in Beni, Oicha, Mabalako, and Komanda, bringing the total to 363, for a case-fatality rate of 61%. All of the newly reported deaths were recorded in the community, which means greater virus exposure to family and caregivers and a higher risk of further cases.

On Dec 29 the DRC health ministry reported no new confirmed cases ""because of the paralysis of the activities of the riposte [response] in Beni, Butembo, Komanda, and Mabalako."" Immunization, contact tracing, and other response efforts have been stopped or dramatically curtailed in recent days because of violent protests.

For example, three health centers in Beni were ransacked on Dec 27 and 28, and two of them burned, Media Congo reported late last week.

The health ministry said on Dec 29, ""The activities of the response resumed timidly this Saturday, December 29, 2018, in Beni and Butembo. The rehabilitation works of the Beni Transit Center are underway. The removal of barricades placed on the roads by the demonstrators allowed the ambulances to circulate and recover some sick patients.

""Laboratories in both cities were operational. No vaccination activity took place for the third day in a row. Some dignified and safe burials were made in both health zones.""

In its update today the DRC health ministry said Ebola vaccinations have yet to resume, keeping the number of people vaccinated at 53,737. Officials said, however, that they are investigating 47 suspected cases.

Several weeks ago the DRC Ebola outbreak grew to become the second-largest in history. The immense West Africa outbreak of 2014-2016 affected 28,616 people, including 11,310 deaths, for a case-fatality rate of 40%.

The third-largest Ebola outbreak occurred in Uganda in 2000, with 425 cases and a death rate of 53%.

Dec 28 Media Congo story",no result found,no result found,"BENI, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Residents of an Ebola hotspot in eastern Congo staged a mock presidential election on Sunday to show the authorities a decision to postpone the vote there due to health fears was unfounded.

Hundreds waited in line in Beni, an opposition stronghold, to get fake voter IDs stamped by men dressed as election officials.

They then cast their votes in improvised urns and showed off ink-stained index fingers to prove they participated - just like people across the country voting for real.

Hand-washing stations were set up to minimize the contagion risk from the six-month Ebola outbreak, which is the second-worst in history.

On Wednesday, the electoral board (CENI) postponed the long-anticipated vote in a number of towns in Democratic Republic of Congo, citing concerns about the epidemic and ethnic violence, but the move was seen by some as an effort to suppress votes for the opposition.

“We suffer a lot here in Beni,” said one participant in the mock election. “They have now come with an excuse about Ebola. How come they are not shutting down markets, roads and churches?”

The electoral pantomime was a more peaceful response than last week, when protesters barricaded the streets and attacked Ebola centers in the wake of the CENI’s decision.

By Stanis Bujakera and Fiston Mahamba

KINSHASA, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo’s government cut internet connections and SMS services across the country for a second straight day on Tuesday as the country nervously awaited the first results from the weekend’s chaotic presidential election.

Both the opposition and ruling coaltion said on Monday they were on track to win after a turbulent election day on Sunday in which many Congolese were unable to vote due to an Ebola outbreak, conflict and logistical problems.

Barnabe Kikaya bin Karubi, a senior adviser to President Joseph Kabila, said internet and SMS services were cut to preserve public order after “fictitious results” began circulating on social media.

“That could lead us straight toward chaos,” Kikaya told Reuters, adding the connections would remain cut until the publication of complete results on Jan. 6.

The signal to Radio France Internationale (RFI), one of the most popular news sources in Congo, was also down, and the government withdrew the accreditation of RFI’s main correspondent in Congo late on Monday for having aired unofficial results from the opposition.

The various moves reflected high tensions in Congo, where the long-delayed election was meant to choose a successor to Kabila, who is due to step down next month after 18 years in power - and two years after the official end of his mandate.

Congo has never seen a democratic transfer of power, and any disputed outcome could lead to a repeat of the violence that followed the 2006 and 2011 elections and a wider security breakdown in its volatile eastern provinces.

The opposition says the election was marred by fraud and accused Kabila of planning to rule from the sidelines through his preferred candidate, former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. The government said the election was fair.

In the eastern city of Goma, residents were on edge as they awaited the first partial results, which could come as soon as later on Tuesday.

“If the results during the publication of the presidential results don’t reflect the truth ... trouble will break out across the city,” said Fabrice Shweka, a Goma resident.

In Sunday’s poll, Shadary faced off against two main opposition challengers, Felix Tshisekedi and Martin Fayulu.

In a statement late on Monday, Fayulu complained about irregularities during Sunday’s vote but said he was encouraged by the determination of Congolese to vote despite long queues and voting machines that broke down.

“I call for vigilance across the board and the general mobilisation of all Congolese so that the truth of the ballot box, the sole witness to the will of the Congolese people, can reward their efforts and sacrifices,” he said.

In other developments, Samaritan's Purse, a group that was instrumental in treating Ebola patients in West Africa's outbreak, announced plans to open an Ebola treatment center in the outbreak region, and Oxfam announced a suspension in activities due to continuing unrest.

Wounded vaccination worker airlifted

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, was in the outbreak region yesterday to spend time with Ebola responders, according his Twitter account. ""While the rest of the world is celebrating, Ebola responders are still hard at work, away from their families doing everything they can to control the outbreak,"" Tedros said. ""Honoured to welcome the new year with them.""

In an update today, Tedros said the wounded vaccination worker was airlifted out of the area for advanced care and that a missing worker has been retrieved. ""My enormous respect for heroic responders who continue to save lives despite the difficult situation,"" he added.

Wellcome Trust Director Jeremy Farrar, MD, PhD, was on the evacuation flight and is with Tedros today to assess the outbreak and what extra support he can offer. Tedros also praised the work of Mike Ryan, MD, WHO assistant director-general for emergency preparedness and response, for leading teams at headquarters and on the ground, and the United Nations MONUSCO for its evacuation efforts.

New cases in 4 hot spots

Of the 10 new confirmed cases, 3 are in Oicha, 3 in Beni, 2 in Butembo, and 2 in Katwa, the health ministry said in updates yesterday and today. The new illnesses boost the outbreak total to 608 cases, which includes 560 confirmed and 48 probable cases.

In addition, 29 suspected cases are still under investigation, a number that dropped from 54 the day before as response efforts have been hindered by violence in outbreak zones.

Officials also said that 5 more people have died from their illnesses, 3 in Beni, plus 1 each in Butembo and Oicha. Two of the deaths occurred in the community, a factor known to increase the risk of virus spread, given that family caregivers don't have personal protective gear and because virus levels are at their highest during the severe phase of illness and at death.

The fatality count is now at 368.

Regarding vaccination activities, the ministry said yesterday that protests related to a national election voting delay in some Ebola-hit areas interrupted immunization in six locations: Goma, Beni, Butembo, Katwa, Komanda, and Mabalako.

According to today's update, since the immunization campaign began with Merck's unlicensed VSV-EBOV vaccine on Aug 8, 54,153 people have been vaccinated.

Samaritan's Purse to open treatment center

Meanwhile, Samaritan's Purse said yesterday that it will open a 20-bed treatment center, which will be housed in an emergency field hospital that was flown to Africa in November. If needed, the unit can be expanded to 60 beds. Samaritan's Purse is a nondenominational Christian international relief organization based in Boone, N.C.

On the day after Christmas a 21-member disaster assistance response team left for the DRC, and since then, other staff have arrived in the country. The group said it has had a country office in the DRC for 8 years and had already been working on community awareness campaigns in the current outbreak.

It has also installed five isolation centers and provided infection prevention and control training for 15 local health centers.

Oxfam suspends work due to protests

Oxfam, one of several nongovernmental organizations involved in the response, said in a Dec 28 statement that violent protests in Beni and Butembo in the wake of election problems has forced it to suspend its work at the locations. According to the WHO's regular situation reports, Oxfam has been supporting vaccination, community engagement, infection prevention and control, and patient care.

A long-delayed general election was held on Dec 30, but a few days earlier, the country's election commission announced a voting delay for people in some outbreak areas, triggering violent protests.

Raphael Mbuyi, the group's acting country director, said, ""This is an extremely worrying situation, as every time the Ebola response has been suspended before we've seen a big spike in the number of new cases. This could mean Ebola spreading to even more people and potentially other countries in the region, putting many more lives at risk.""

However, he added that it's not surprising that people who have lost their votes at the last minute are frustrated and taking to the streets.

The qualified endorsement from the regional body on Wednesday countered allegations by opposition candidates that the December 30 vote was marred by widespread irregularities.

Approval of the election's results by SADC powers like South Africa and Angola will be critical for the legitimacy of the administration of the next president, who will succeed incumbent Joseph Kabila on January 18.

Pre-election polling showed Kabila's preferred candidate, ex-interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, trailing the main opposition candidates, Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi, but both sides say they expect to win.

The election is meant to lead to Congo's first democratic transfer of power in 59 years of independence. But more than a million Congolese in opposition strongholds were prevented from voting due to an Ebola outbreak, local factional conflict and various logistical problems.

""Taking into account the range of challenges posed by these elections, the [mission] observed that the elections ... were relatively well-managed,"" the SADC mission said in its statement.

Provisional results are expected on January 6, with the final outcome on January 15.

Internet blocked

On Monday, the authorities cut off internet cross the vast central African country in an apparent effort by the government to prevent social media speculation about the results of the vote.

Meanwhile, Radio France International said on Wednesday the government had revoked the accreditation of one of its journalists and cut off the station's broadcasts.

Confirming the move, Lambert Mende, a spokesperson for the government, accused the station of stirring up controversy. He said its journalist, Florence Morice, had violated electoral laws.

""We are not going to let a radio station throw petrol on the flames at a time when we are waiting for the compilation of the provisional results,"" Mende said.

RFI said its coverage had been impartial.

Also on Wednesday, an African Union observer mission said that election day, which also included votes for national and provincial assembly members, was peaceful yet blighted by a number of logistical problems.

""The holding of these elections constitutes, in itself, a first great victory for the Congolese people,"" it said in a statement.

""The mission strongly wishes that the results that will be declared are true to the vote of the Congolese people.""

Kabila's government refused to accredit election monitors from the European Union and the US-based Carter Center, which said there were widespread irregularities in the 2011 election.

The DRC is now entering its sixth month of the country's largest Ebola outbreak ever, in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. So far, the disease has been contained in the eastern region of the DRC, but the election chaos increases the chance of international spread.

Irene Nakasiita, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Uganda, told the Associated Press (AP) that dozens of refugees began crossing the border on Dec 30. Some were made to return to the DRC after refusing Ebola screening implemented by Ugandan officials.

Internet shut down after election

The AP also reported that the internet in the DRC has been cut off all week to curb speculation about the election results. On Twitter today, the DRC said there would be no daily update from the ministry of health on Ebola cases. Instead, the ministry said today's update will be published tomorrow morning.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains an Ebola outbreak dashboard, which today reflects 603 cases, 555 of which are confirmed. But that's 5 fewer cases than the DRC reported yesterday, when the ministry of health noted 608 cases and 368 deaths.

More than 54,000 people have been vaccinated against the virus, and officials from the DRC and WHO have requested more vaccines.

Situation growing more complex

The new year brought fresh violence to the outbreak region, once again delaying surveillance tracking and vaccination efforts, the WHO said today in a press release.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, MD returned today from a 3-day mission to the outbreak zone.

""I'm concerned about the impact of the recent disruptions at this critical moment. This outbreak is occurring in the most difficult context imaginable,"" Tedros said. ""To end it the response needs to be supported and expanded, not further complicated. Ebola is unforgiving, and disruptions give the virus the advantage.""

Accompanying Tedros was Wellcome Trust Director Jeremy Farrar, MD, PhD.

""This outbreak is in a critical phase. It is vital the international community recognizes this and ensures the DRC and WHO have the support needed to ensure this outbreak does not spiral out of control,"" Farrar said.

Despite the use of an effective vaccine and four novel Ebola treatments, the outbreak has continued because of security challenges, community resistance, and poor infection control in health facilities, the WHO said.

The elections will determine the successor of President Joseph Kabila, who has been at the helm of sub-Saharan Africa's biggest country for nearly 18 years.

Kabila refused to step down after his two-term constitutional limit ended in 2016, sparking protests that were quelled at the cost of scores of lives.

Pre-election polling showed Kabila's preferred candidate, ex-Minister of the Interior Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, trailing the main opposition candidates, Martin Fayulu and Tshisekedi, but both sides say they expect to win.

The African Union (AU) issued a statement on Wednesday saying Sunday's vote had taken place ""in a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere, despite interference and all the security, political and organisational challenges.""

""The holding of these elections constitutes, in itself, a first great victory for the Congolese people,"" the statement said. ""The mission strongly wishes that the results that will be declared are true to the vote of the Congolese people.""

Broadcasts, internet curb

Meanwhile, the Congolese ruling party said the internet shutdown, which has been in place since Monday, will continue, to prevent disorder.

""The Common Front for the Congo (FCC) regrets the internet shutdown since Monday, but notes that some people tried to use the internet to pit the Congolese people against each other,"" said Barnabe Kikaya Bin Karubi, FCC spokesperson.

""We ask the population to remain calm and wait peacefully for the provisional results that the electoral commission will publish in the coming days,"" he told reporters.

Amid tensions over the vote counting, authorities have also pulled accreditation for a French radio journalist and cut broadcasts from the station, as well as a local television channel.

Government spokesman Lambert Mende accused Radio France Internationale (RFI) correspondent in Kinshasa, Florence Morice, of violating electoral law and ""the code of good conduct for foreign journalists covering the elections"".

""We are not going to let a radio station throw petrol on the flames at a time when we are waiting for the compilation of the provisional results,"" Mende said.

Mende said authorities also cut the signal of local Canal Congo television, seen as close to the opposition, for broadcasting election results before an official announcement.

Preliminary election results are due by Sunday, definitive results by January 15, with the next head of state due to be sworn in on January 18.

4-Jan-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The response by WHO and partners to the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak continues despite disruptions to key services due to security incidents taking place in Beni and Butembo during the recent election on 30 December 2018. In order to ensure the safety of all staff deployed, as a precautionary measure, operations were scaled back for a few hours on election day. All normal operations have been fully restored as of 1 January 2019. After an intensification of field activities in early December, notable improvements can be observed in many areas, notably a decrease in cases in Beni. However, hard-earned progress could still be lost to rebound levels of transmission resulting from prolonged periods of insecurity hampering containment efforts.

During the reporting period (27 December 2018 – 2 January 2019), 16 newly confirmed cases were reported from Beni (two), Butembo (five), Katwa (three), Komanda (one), Mabalako (one), and Oicha (four) health zones (Figure 1). As of 2 January 2019, there have been a total of 609 EVD cases1 (561 confirmed and 48 probable, Figure 2), including 370 deaths and 208 people having recovered. Overall, cases are occurring in localised hotspots within 16 health zones found in North Kivu and Ituri. Amongst confirmed and probable cases, the case load has been highest in females aged 15-49 who are eligible for vaccination (i.e. non-pregnant), and also females aged 50 years and older (Figure 3). Amongst confirmed and probable cases, 61% (374/609) were female (median age = 28) and were predominantly older than male cases (median age = 25.5). Of note, 16% (96/607) of cases were among children less than five years old, and 7% (41/607) were infants less than one year old. Most of the cases among children aged five years old or more were from Beni, 48% (46/96). There were 29 cases among pregnant women, of which 14 were from Beni. Fifteen of the 29 cases were reportedly breastfeeding women.

As of 2 January, a total of 86 cases of nosocomial infection were reported in patients from the general public, primarily from Beni (34), Butembo (13), Katwa (11) and Mabalako (eight). There have been no new cases in healthcare workers during this reporting period. To date, there have been a total of 55 EVD cases involving healthcare workers, of which 18 have died and eight were hospitalised as patients. Of the healthcare workers with available clinical information, 36% (18/50) died. Eleven healthcare workers were reportedly infected in a general hospital while the other 30 health facilities reported between one to three cases each during the entire outbreak period. It should be noted that 22% (133/609) of all cases had history of exposure to a hospital 1-21 days prior to the onset of their illness.

Thorough contact tracing during initial case investigations remains difficult in light of continued community resistance and the deteriorating security situation in the field during the recent elections. This resulted in a number of new confirmed cases not being identified as potential contacts. Of all cases, 66% (327/495) had known contact with a case, and 37% (177/478) had attended a funeral. A sizeable proportion of cases, 34% (155/451), had both these exposures.

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as in Uganda. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside of the above mentioned outbreak affected areas.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries. Infection prevention and control practices in health care facilities, especially antenatal clinics, need to be further strengthened.

For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the country bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include: travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO’s risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advice against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

And in the wake of election protest disruptions, all normal response operations have been restored as of Jan 1, the WHO said today.

In another Ebola development, a man in Sweden who got sick after traveling to Burundi was isolated and hospitalized in Uppsala with suspected Ebola, but tests today came back negative.

Though part of Burundi borders the DRC, no cases have been reported from that country.

Death count reaches 370

In a delayed update for Jan 3, the DRC's health ministry today reported one more case, a patient from Komanda in Ituri province. Also, the online dashboard from the WHO's African regional office reflects four additional cases, which would raise the outbreak total to 613 cases, including 565 confirmed and 54 suspected cases. Health officials are still investigating 54 suspected infections.

In addition, the Jan 3 DRC update reported 2 more deaths, 1 in Beni and the other in Butembo, lifting the outbreak's fatality count to 370.

The number of people vaccinated has reached 54,522, according to yesterday's statement.

Regarding vaccination, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said in a Stat interview upon his return from a New Year's visit to the outbreak region that the DRC's Ebola count would be much higher without use of Merck's experimental VSV-EBOV vaccine.

He told Stat that he based his assessment on the fact that infections haven't grown exponentially, though he said the WHO should explore the projected impact of the vaccine on the outbreak through modeling studies.

Nosocomial illnesses, hard-hit groups

In a weekly update yesterday, the WHO said outbreak response efforts continue, despite recent disruptions in Beni and Butembo connected to the Dec 30 national election. It said that, to ensure the safety of staff, operations were scaled back for a few hours on election day but have been fully restored.

The agency warned, however, that, after stepped-up field activities in December that led to a drop in cases in Beni, the outbreak's main hot spot, progress could be lost if prolonged security problems stymie efforts to contain the spread of Ebola.

The report also had more detailed information about healthcare-acquired infections and illness patterns. It said that, as of Jan 2, 86 nosocomial infections have been reported, mainly in Beni, Butembo, Katwa, and Mabalako. No new illnesses in healthcare workers have been reported, keeping that total at 55, including 18 deaths.

Of all cases reported in the outbreak, 22% had a history of exposure to a hospital within 3 weeks of getting sick, the WHO said.

The caseload has been highest in female patients ages 15 to 49 who are eligible for vaccination—meaning they aren't pregnant—followed by women age 50 and older. Females make up 61% of confirmed and probable cases, and there have been 29 illnesses in pregnant women, 14 of them in Beni. Fifteen of the infected women were breastfeeding.

Another feature of the DRC's outbreak has been a higher-than-expected number of illnesses in children. In today's update, the WHO said 16% of cases (96) have been in children younger than 5 years, mostly from Beni, and that 7% (41) involved babies younger than 1.

Contact tracing has been a challenge in light of continuing community resistance and insecurity, resulting in a number of new cases that hadn't been previously identified as contacts. Of all patients, 66% had known contact with an earlier case-patient, 37% had attended a funeral, and 34% had both types of exposure.

Swedish traveler tests negative

Meanwhile, media reports earlier today from Sweden said a man with a suspected Ebola infection was hospitalized at University Hospital in Uppsala. He developed bloody vomiting after a trip to Burundi in central Africa, but was not known to have visited areas where the virus is circulating.

In an update this afternoon, a government statement from Uppsala region said the man had been in Burundi for a number of weeks. It said his tests were also negative for yellow fever, dengue, Marburg, and Rift Valley fever viruses.

The man's symptoms are improving, and test for other infectious diseases are under way. He is no longer in isolation, and the hospital will reopen its emergency department.

Jan 3 WHO situation report",no result found,no result found,no result found,"A health worker wounded in an attack in the DRC is evacuated in a helicopter carrying WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (second from right) and other health officials.

The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the second worst on record, having topped 600 cases. But the case count would be much higher still if an experimental Ebola vaccine were not being used to contain spread of the disease, the director-general of the World Health Organization said Thursday.

“One thing I am really certain of now is: If it wasn’t for the vaccine we’re using, the number of cases we have could have been really high, high, high,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told STAT upon his return to Geneva from the DRC after spending three days meeting with Ebola response teams and assessing the situation.

The vaccine, which is being developed by Merck, is being given to health care workers, others on the front lines of the response effort, and people who are contacts of cases — and contacts of the contacts — to protect them and prevent onward spread of the virus. To date, more than 54,000 doses of vaccine have been administered in this outbreak.

The assessment of vaccine’s effectiveness by Tedros, as he is known, is based on the fact that the case count hasn’t grown exponentially, not on modeling calculations. He suggested, though, that the WHO should explore the question through modeling studies.

The director-general’s visit to the DRC coincided with a period of widespread and violent unrest in the affected parts of the country, triggered by contentious and long-delayed national elections.

The violence has prompted some of the WHO’s response partners — Oxfam and the International Rescue Committee — to suspend operations. Other groups, including Doctors Without Borders, have reduced the number of staff members they have in the region or moved non-Congolese personnel out of the region temporarily.

The WHO has not lowered staff levels, and Tedros urged partners to stick with the fight.

“This is a very dangerous enemy and we have to stay,” he said. “If we leave … the virus will get an advantage and will spread freely. Not only for DRC, it will be bad for the neighboring countries and even beyond.”

Tedros traveled to the region — against the advice of security personnel, he said — with Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, the world’s second richest medical charity. The director-general said he wanted to spend New Year’s with people working to quell the outbreak, to express his appreciation and respect for their efforts. “They have been there for months, risking their lives,” he said.

While Tedros was visiting one of the transmission hot spots, a health zone called Komanda, a team of Ebola responders working to vaccinate people were attacked with stones. One, a woman, was briefly kidnapped. Another, a man, was injured; he was flown out for care in the helicopter that transported Tedros and the people accompanying him. He is recovering, Tedros said.

The national elections, which were held Dec. 30, have stirred up the violence, but the region has been a conflict zone for decades, and sporadic rebel attacks on government forces or United Nations peacekeepers have hampered the outbreak response from the start. A violent incident in August prompted the State Department to order U.S. government employees, including experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, out of northeastern DRC. They haven’t been allowed back since — though there are some Americans in the region working for charities and non-governmental organizations.

That position has led to criticism that the U.S. isn’t doing enough to help contain the outbreak. But Tedros said the criticism is unwarranted and that other countries have decided not to send government workers to help with the outbreak response.

“It’s not specific to the U.S. government,” he said. “[It’s] almost everybody. Especially all the high-income countries.”

Tedros said he met with President Trump at the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November. The president spoke openly of his support for what the WHO is doing in DRC, the director-general said.

Tedros said he speaks regularly with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar; Mark Green, who heads USAID; and Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC. “We are getting the support we need from them,” he said.

The U.S. is supporting, financially, the operations of some NGOs in the field and has deployed staff to WHO headquarters in Geneva, to Kinshasa in the DRC, and to other places in East Africa, he added. Some CDC staff have been working with countries neighboring the DRC to help them prepare to quickly spot and safely treat Ebola cases, should the disease cross their borders.

As for the question of whether the outbreak should be declared a global health emergency, Tedros said he would consider reconvening an advisory group of experts to look at the issue if the situation worsens. When members of the group met in October, they decided the outbreak did not constitute a public health emergency of international concern — a PHEIC, in global health law parlance.

“I don’t worry, to be honest, whether we call it a PHEIC or not. Because we’re following it 24/7,” he said."

US President Donald Trump told US Congress on Friday that the first of about 80 troops had arrived in Gabon on Wednesday to protect US citizens and diplomatic facilities should violence break out in DRC's capital Kinshasa.

Voters in the DRC went to the polls on December 30, two years after the election was first scheduled to be held, to elect the successor to President Joseph Kabila, who has been in power for 18 years.

""The first of these personnel arrived in Gabon on January 2, 2019, with appropriate combat equipment and supported by military aircraft,"" Trump's letter to Congress read.

""Additional forces may deploy to Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or the Republic of the Congo, if necessary for these purposes.

""These deployed personnel will remain in the region until the security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo becomes such that their presence is no longer needed.""

The DRC's electoral commission is scheduled to release the provisional results of the presidential election on Sunday, but it has said there could be delays because of the slow arrival of tally sheets.

'Potential unrest'

Observers and the opposition say the election was marred by serious irregularities, the DRC's government says the election was fair and went smoothly.

Kabila's ruling coalition is backing his hand-picked successor Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary.

Observers and the international community have raised concerns that a disputed result could cause unrest, as was the case after the 2006 and 2011 elections.

Al Kitenge, CEO of London-based Innovation Task Force, said there was ""huge risk of trouble in the coming days"".

""We've had violence in the countryside for the past 40 years... Today everyone is worried because the violence might spread to Kinshasa. The people most at risk in such a case are civilians and we hope everything can be done to avoid that,"" he told Al Jazeera.

On Thursday, the US Department of State called on the electoral commission to ensure votes were accurately counted and threatened to impose sanctions against those who undermined the process or threatened peace and stability in the country.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) also warned against any manipulation of the results.

""The African Union and other governments should make clear to Congo's leadership that any manipulation of the election results will have serious consequences,"" said Ida Sawyer, deputy Africa director at HRW.

The outbreak now stands at 625 cases, of which 577 are confirmed and 48 are probable. A total of 377 deaths have been recorded, and 101 suspected cases are still under investigation.

Four of the cases were reported late on Friday, Jan 4. by the DRC health ministry.

Treatment centers open

On Jan 3, DRC officials opened a 16-bed Ebola treatment center in Katwa health zone to treat more patients in that region, and the ministry of health said the Beni transit center is operational again after the building was attacked during election protests on Dec 27.

Vaccination efforts are still under way throughout the region, with 56,509people vaccinated, including 19,619 in Beni, 11,526 in Katwa, 6,369 in Butembo, 5,550 in Mabalako, health ministry said.

Election results still unknown

The new cases come as the DRC still awaits results of its presidential election. Violence erupted across the country, including in outbreak zones, in the last week of December as protesters displayed frustration with the election process. Officials also eliminated internet access for most of last week to stop the spread of disinformation.

The election will determine who follows Joseph Kabila's rule. Kabila took office in 2001, and, according to the BBC, has promised the nation its first orderly transfer of power since the DRC gained independent from Belgium in 1960.

Yesterday officials said only half of the ballots had been counted, but certain groups, including Catholic leaders, said there was a clear winner, and results were being obfuscated from the public.

On Friday, Reuters reported that US President Donald Trump said he was sending 80 military personnel to Gabon on Wednesday, in case they are needed to protect US citizens and diplomatic facilities in Congo's capital, Kinshasa. The move came in direct response to the DRC's election protests.

In a letter to Congress, Trump said the personnel ""will remain in the region until the security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo becomes such that their presence is no longer needed,"" according to Reuters.

In September, Trump pulled out American public health workers from the Ebola outbreak region because of security issues, a move widely criticized at the time. Some Americans stayed on in the DRC, including a healthcare worker with a possible exposure to Ebola who was evacuated from the DRC in late December.

According to a statement from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), the worker was taken to Nebraska Medical Center, one of several of places in the United States with a dedicated biocontainment unit.

SHEA, which in the statement called for a coordinated response to the outbreak, said there is no health risk to the US public over this evacuation.

Health officials are still investigating 98 suspected Ebola cases.

Five more deaths were reported: three in Butembo and one each in Beni and Katwa. The fatality from Katwa involves someone who died in the community, a factor known to increase the risk of Ebola transmission.

The number of people who received the VSV-EBOV vaccine continues to rise. Since Aug 8, 58,866 people have been vaccinated.

The World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said today in a weekly outbreak and health emergency report that Butembo, Katwa, and Oicha are the current main hot spots in the outbreak, which is now entering its sixth month. It said resumption in response activities in the wake of recent election protest disruptions is encouraging, but more interruptions could pose serious problems for timely containment of the outbreak.

New filovirus identified in samples from Chinese bat

Tests on samples from a Rousettus bat in China have revealed a new filovirus, named Mengla virus, that is similar to Ebola and Marburg viruses, a team from Singapore's Duke-NUS Medical School and China reported yesterday in Nature Microbiology.

The new virus was found during analysis of filovirus diversity in the bat species, and researchers named it Mengla virus, because it was discovered in Mengla County in China's Yunnan province.

Genetic sequencing suggests Mengla virus is part of a new genus called Dianlovirus within the filovirus group and is genetically distinct, sharing just 32% to 54% genetic similarity with other known filoviruses. The team reported that it is found in different geographic locations compared to other filoviruses, could contain more one species, and sits between Ebola virus and Marburg virus on the evolutionary tree, Duke University Medical School said in a press release.

Functional tests using cell lines from different animal species found that, similar to other filoviruses, Mengla virus poses a risk of interspecies transmission. Characterization of genome organization revealed that Mengla virus uses the same molecular receptor, a protein called NPC1, as Ebola and Marburg do to enter cells and trigger infection. So far, the new filovirus has been found only in bats, and more tests will be done to better gauge the risk of transmission to other species.

Patrick Casey, PhD, senior vice dean of research at Duke-NUS Medical School, said in the press release, ""With globalisation, it is important to identify and assess the risk of potential infectious disease outbreaks and, from it, develop effective controls strategies and treatments.""

Study: Screening US blood donations for Zika not cost effective

A new study in Annals of Internal Medicine suggests that screening blood bank donations for Zika virus is cost effective only for donations made in Puerto Rico during high mosquito season, but not for donations in all 50 United States.

The study echoes work published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) last May, which showed that screening in the United States cost about $42 million in the 15 months after the Zika outbreak emerged and identified only nine Zika-positive donations.

In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration recommended the universal screening of all blood donations for Zika, but researchers from Stanford University Vitalant Research Institute and the American Red Cross used a microsimulation to show that the screening was only effective during Puerto Rico's high mosquito season at $81,123 per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) (95% confidence interval [CI], −$49 138 to $978 242 per QALY).

""If the ZIKV rate among donors remained unchanged, we would expect transfusion transmission of ZIKV to result in 1 case of Guillain–Barre syndrome every 16 years in Puerto Rico (every 84 years in the 50 states) and 1 case of congenital Zika syndrome every 33 years in Puerto Rico (every 176 years in the 50 states) without screening,"" the authors concluded.

More than 400 new yellow fever cases reported in Nigeria

Since the previous update issued on Dec 18, Nigeria has recorded 494 new suspected cases and 31 additional deaths in an ongoing yellow fever outbreak.

According to an update today from the WHO African regional office, there have been 4,004 suspected cases of the virus recorded in Nigeria since September of 2017, including 33 deaths (case fatality ratio 0.8%). Among confirmed cases, the case-fatality rate is 16%.

All 36 of Nigeria's states have recorded cases, with Edo state recording 46 suspected cases in the last 3 weeks.

""The outbreak in Edo state is occurring close to the state capital, Benin city, which is densely populated with high population movements due to national and international trade. The high population mobility and suboptimal vaccination coverage within Nigeria and in neighbouring countries, represent risk factors for the continued transmission and further spread of the disease,"" the WHO said.

During the last week of December, more than 1.4 million Nigerians in Edo state and other targeted areas received the yellow fever vaccine as part of a broad campaign to stop the outbreak. Nigeria introduced the yellow fever vaccine into routine immunizations in 2016, but much of the population is still at risk for contracting the mosquito-borne virus.

10-Jan-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

WHO and partners continue to respond to the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in one of the most complex settings possible. A decline in case incidence has been seen in Beni, the former epicentre. This is a strong positive indication of how effective the response can be despite multiple challenges. However, in Beni and elsewhere, trends must be interpreted cautiously, as delayed detection of cases is expected following recent temporary disruption in response activities due to insecurity. Nevertheless, WHO and partners remain committed, under the government’s leadership and through collaboration across agencies, to addressing challenges and ending the outbreak.

As of 8 January 2019, there have been a total of 628 EVD cases1 (580 confirmed and 48 probable), including 383 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 61%). Thus far, 222 people have recovered, been discharged from an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) and enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors.

During the last 21 days (19 December 2018 to 8 January 2019), cases have been reported from ten health zones where the outbreak remains active, including: Katwa (18), Butembo (16), Oicha (13), Beni (13), Kalungata (6), Mabalako (5), Komanda (3), Musienene (2), Kyondo (1) and Nyankunde (1). Overall, cases have occurred in localised hotspots within 16 health zones found in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 1). Surveillance activities are being maintained to rapidly detect resurgences or reintroduction events in all areas.

Trends in numbers of new cases occurring (Figure 2) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across these geographically dispersed areas, with encouraging declines in case incidence in areas such as Beni. Hard-earned progress could still be lost from prolonged periods of insecurity hampering containment efforts.

Amongst confirmed and probable EVD cases, 61% (385/628) were female and 30% (189/628) were children aged less than 18 years. This includes a high number of cases in infants aged less than 1 year (38) and 1-4 years (58). While investigations to understand the risk factors for this disproportionate burden are ongoing, response teams continue to prioritise these population groups to mitigate, wherever possible, the risk of transmission.

All alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries continue to be monitored and investigated. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda and in a traveller returning from Burundi to Sweden. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside the outbreak affected areas. International travellers who may have come into contact with the virus, including a doctor who returned to the United States of America after providing medical assistance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are also being followed closely; all remain asymptomatic.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO reviewed its risk assessment for the outbreak and the risk remains very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Tshisekedi opposed the candidate handpicked by the departing president, Joseph Kabila, and some groups have already called the victory an ""election coup,"" according to a story in The Guardian, because Tshisekedi also bested Martin Fayulu, who held a healthy polling lead going into the election. Scattered violent protests have already been reported.

In research news, tests in animals show promise for a new monoclonal antibody therapy.

Three new cases

Against the election backdrop, new cases of Ebola are still being recorded in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Yesterday the DRC recorded a new case in Katwa and a new community death from Ebola in the same town. Community deaths pose a greater risk of transmission than those that take place in a hospital or Ebola treatment center.

As of yesterday, the Ebola outbreak stands at 628 cases, of which 580 are confirmed. There have been 383 deaths, and the DRC said data on the number of cases still under investigation was not available.

Today the DRC health ministry said cases rose to 630, reflecting 2 new cases, both confirmed and fatal, with 122 suspected cases still under investigation. The new deaths are in Katwa and Biena, and both occurred in the community.

DRC officials also noted that the number of people vaccinated has now topped 58,000.

In its daily update yesterday, the DRC ministry of health also said the first baby born to a survivor of the current outbreak was born on Jan 6 and shows no sign of the virus. Baby Sylvana was born at a treatment center in Beni. Her mother survived an Ebola infection in December and agreed to have her child born at an Ebola treatment center.

""Fortunately, Baby Sylvana has been tested twice and the results have come back negative,"" the ministry of health said.

Last month DRC officials reported that a baby born to an Ebola-infected mother had survived an infection, but the woman had died during childbirth.

Promise for experimental treatment

Every patient in this outbreak has received medical treatment for the virus, including ZMapp, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. Today, two new studies in Cell Host & Microbe showed that a new cocktail of Ebola virus mAbs was protective in guinea pigs, ferrets, and rhesus macaques.

All tested therapies were effective for more than one of the six viruses in the Ebola family, of which four cause deadly hemorrhagic fevers in humans.

In the first study, two antibodies isolated from an Ebola survivor offered protection against both Sudan ebolavirus and Ebola virus in guinea pigs. The next-generation human mAb cocktail, MBP134AF, exhibited glycoproteins that targeted all six strains of Ebola, the study authors said.

In a second study, the cocktail, given in a single dose, was shown protective in eight ferrets and 10 monkeys.

""The developmental path of MBP134AF presents a model for the rapid design of next-generation antiviral immunotherapeutics targeting World Health Organization-priority pathogens,"" the study authors concluded.

The Dec. 30 vote was supposed to mark Congo’s first uncontested democratic transfer of power in 59 years of independence, and the beginning of a new era after 18 years of chaotic rule by President Joseph Kabila.

But irregularities including faulty voting machines, poorly run polling stations and a halt in the vote for over a million people due to insecurity and an Ebola outbreak in opposition strongholds, have overshadowed talk of democratic progress.

Sunday’s intervention by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which contains regional allies of Kinshasa like South Africa and Angola, could push Kabila to tackle the presidential runner-up’s accusations that the vote was rigged.

Second-place finisher Martin Fayulu says he in fact won by a landslide and that the official winner, opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi, struck a deal with Kabila to be declared the victor. Tshisekedi and Kabila deny this.

Isolated post-election violence in the country of 80 million people that sprawls across central Africa, has many fearing a return to the kind of conflict and upheaval that has killed millions since the 1990s.

Congo is the world’s leading miner of cobalt, a mineral used in electric car batteries, Africa’s biggest copper producer and also mines gold and diamonds.

International pressure on Kabila has been building since the vote, in part because Congo’s influential Catholic Church said that tallies compiled by its 40,000-strong monitoring team show a different winner to that announced by the electoral commission, without saying who.

France, Belgium, the United States and Britain have all expressed concern about the vote.

But the SADC will hold greater sway in Congo. Its approval of the election results are critical for the legitimacy of president-elect Tshisekedi’s new government.

SADC previously said the election went “relatively well” despite some problems. But on Sunday it said it had taken note of the “strong doubts” cast on the poll by the Church.

“A recount would provide the necessary reassurance to both winners and losers,” a SADC statement said.

CREDIBILITY AT STAKE

The Church’s bishops conference, known as CENCO, was not immediately available for comment on Sunday, nor were spokespeople for Kabila and Tshisekedi.

But Fayulu, who has already called for a recount, welcomed the announcement.

“It is essential that this process of recounting and validating the real results be carried out in all transparency, in order to proclaim the real winner,” he said in an emailed statement.

“The credibility of the process is at stake.”

The 16-nation SADC also recommended a government of national unity including parties representing Kabila, Fayulu and Tshisekedi that could promote internal peace.

“SADC draws the attention of Congolese politicians to similar arrangements that were very successful in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya (that created the) necessary stability for durable peace,” the statement said.

The chances of this kind of unity in Congo appear slim for now. Fayulu, who is backed by bitter political rivals of Kabila, on Saturday filed an election complaint with the Constitutional Court to have the result overturned.

Meanwhile, Kabila’s ruling coalition won a majority in legislative elections, according to results announced on Saturday.

This will undercut Tshisekedi’s ability to deliver on campaign promises and fuels suspicions in Fayulu’s camp that Kabila will retain influence over important ministries and the security forces after stepping down.",no result found

In other Ebola developments, an American health worker who may have been exposed to Ebola in the DRC was released from monitoring after remaining symptom-free, and another security incident was reported, affecting responders working in Ituri province.

The continued rise of cases and community resistance is occurring against a backdrop of continuing controversy over the country's recent general election, which officials fear could fuel more protests, especially in outbreak areas where voting was delayed.

Six more community deaths

Of the latest 19 cases, 18 are confirmed and 1 is listed as probable, which the ministry said in its daily report yesterday involves a person who died in Butembo who had an epidemiologic link to a confirmed case, but who could not be tested before burial. The new developments bring the overall outbreak total as of today to 649 cases, which includes 600 confirmed and 49 probable infections.

Fourteen of the most recent cases are from Katwa, located about 7 miles east of Butembo. Officials also confirmed one case each in Butembo, Komanda, Oicha, and Vuhovi.

Ten more people have died from their infections, including six who died in the community in Katwa and Butembo, a factor known to increase the risk of virus spread. The other four deaths occurred at Ebola treatment centers in Butembo, Beni, and Mabalako.

According to today's update, 121 suspected Ebola cases are still under investigation, and the number of people who received the VSV-EBOV vaccine has reached 59,856.

American completes monitoring

An American health worker who was potentially exposed to Ebola while working in the DRC in December and was in monitoring at Nebraska Medical Center, which has a biocontainment unit, has been released after passing the 21-day incubation period without experiencing any symptoms or testing positive for the virus.

In a Jan 12 statement, Nebraska Medicine said the individual never developed the disease and poses no risk to the public. ""This person, who requested privacy during the monitoring process, left our facility and the city of Omaha this morning.""

The health worker, who earlier reports said was a 39-year-old physician, arrived in Omaha for monitoring on Dec 29 in a secure area not accessible to the public or patients. The hospital said if he or she would have developed Ebola, the patient would have been transferred to the biocontainment unit.

Another attack on response workers

In other developments in the outbreak region, residents in the city of Marabo in Ituri province on Jan 11 attacked humanitarian workers who were in the area to build an isolation center in a health facility. The attack prompted the province's acting governor to condemn the violence, according to a Jan 14 report in French from from Radio Okapi, the news network of the United Nations mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) and Fondation Hirondelle, a Swiss nongovernmental organization.

According to the report, protesters opposed the construction of the isolation center, because they believe it will bring the disease into the community. An earlier report on the attack said some of Marabo's resident threw stones at the humanitarian workers.

Post-election ontroversy still swirls

Meanwhile, an influential organization comprising 16 African nations—the Southern African Development Community—has called for a recount in the DRC's Dec 30 presidential election, in which main opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi was declared the surprise winner, the UK-based Guardian reported yesterday.

Ahead of the vote, another opposition leader, Martin Fayulu, was expected to win, leading to accusations that Tshisekedi forged a deal with outgoing longtime president Joseph Kabila—in power since 2001—to be declared the winner.

Election monitoring by the DRC's Catholic church, which had deployed 40,000 election monitors, has backed up Fayulu's claims.

Kabila's supporters apparently won a majority in the national assembly in the recent election, solidifying the former president's power.

In late December, the DRC's election commission announced that voting would be delayed in three cities, two of which are Ebola hot spots: Beni and Butembo. The announcement sparked protests that led to temporary disruptions to Ebola response efforts in the two locations.

Fostering confidence in health authorities is essential when fighting a disease that can spread furiously through communities where local services are scant and patients are often scared to come forward to government or international response teams.

“When you have political instability, public health always suffers,” said Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease expert who recently visited east Congo with a World Health Organization leadership team.

Without public trust, he said, the Congo epidemic could kill many hundreds more people.

The Dec. 30 election was supposed to mark Congo’s first uncontested democratic transfer of power after 18 years of chaotic rule by President Joseph Kabila.

But accusations of fraud and calls for a recount are threatening more volatility and violence after opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi was declared winner.

“The worst case scenario is that political instability remains, mistrust grows ... and then there’s nothing to stop the epidemic getting embedded into a big urban centre and taking off as it did in West Africa,” said Farrar.

“GAINS COULD BE LOST”

Already, 385 people have been killed in the outbreak of Ebola in east Congo that began six months ago and has infected at least 630 people, according to WHO data. The death rate in this epidemic - by far the biggest Congo has seen, and the world’s second largest in history - is more than 60 percent.

Ebola spreads through contact with bodily fluids. It causes hemorrhagic fever with severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding. The outbreak is concentrated in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

There are some signs case numbers in the North Kivu city of Beni may be leveling off, but WHO experts are cautious.

They say the apparent lull might be due to people getting ill but failing to seek proper diagnosis and treatment.

The West Africa Ebola outbreak Farrar referred to lasted for two years from 2014. It infected 28,000 and killed more than 11,300 people in an epidemic that devastated Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea and spread in sporadic cases to several other African countries as well as the United States and Europe.

The WHO says the risk of the disease spreading remains “very high” at national and regional levels and is working urgently with Congo and its neighbors - Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan - to do everything to avoid that happening again.

WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said 25 million people have already been screened for Ebola at border checks with Congo’s neighbors. Vaccination campaigns have also begun for health workers in Uganda and South Sudan.

Jasarevic also said multiple threats to response teams’ ability to find, treat and prevent cases of Ebola infection make the Congo situation particularly worrisome: “Gains could be lost if we suffer a period of prolonged insecurity,” he said.",no result found

The new cases bring the outbreak total to 658, with 609 cases confirmed and 402 deaths. Two hundred cases are still under investigation, which is up from 121 yesterday.

The case in Manguredjipa is linked to an outbreak in the Aloya health area of the Mabalako health zone, DRC officials said.

Six new deaths; vaccinations top 60,000

Since yesterday, 6 new deaths were recorded, including 5 community deaths. These types of deaths take place outside a healthcare or treatment center setting and thus increase the risk of community transmission.

The ring vaccination campaign has now reached 60,460 people, including 19,952 in Beni, 12,590 in Katwa, 6,746 in Butembo, and 5,741 in Mabalako.

The ministry of health also said that efforts began yesterday to rebuild a community health center in Rwangoma that was destroyed during the election protests held in the last week of December. The rehabilitation was funded by community donations.

Ten health districts still active

On Twitter, Peter Salama, MD, the World Health Organization's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said the outbreak is likely active in 10 of the 17 affected health zones, with cases in Beni and Mangina on the decline.

According to epidemiologic graphs, Mabalako and Mandima were the first outbreak epicenters in late July and August, and Beni saw the most cases through the fall months. Recently, Butembo and Katwa have seen more cases.

""The Ebola outbreak in DRC is really several distinct outbreaks in the different affected areas. This means (1) interpreting overall epidemiological trends is complex, and (2) the response has to be adapted to the very different contexts in each area. We can't 'cut and paste,' "" Salama said.

CEPI funds Australia-based rapid vaccine response pipeline

The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI) has provided $14.7 million in funding for a partnership led by scientists at the University of Queensland to develop a rapid response pipeline to develop and test new vaccines against novel and existing infectious disease threats in as little as 16 weeks, according to a press release today from the university.

Keith Chappell, PhD, one of the leaders of the project, said the goal is to make 200,000 doses of a new vaccine, demonstrate safety and the likelihood of efficacy, and have it ready for field deployment in as little as 6 months. The research group has patented a ""molecular clamp"" technology designed to stabilize viral proteins that are the main target of the immune system. The technology is part of a platform to make vaccines against a range of human and animal viruses, with promising results for influenza, Ebola, and Nipah viruses, as well as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The funding will be spread over 3 years, with a clinical trial of a synthesized influenza vaccine slated to begin later this year, the Sydney Morning Herald reported today.

Collaborators also include Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza, Australian national University, Hong Kong University, and Q-Pharm.

CEPI was founded in 2017 as a way to streamline and fund research for new vaccine candidates against three priority diseases: MERS-CoV, Lassa, and Nipah viruses. It is supported by the governments of Norway, Germany, India, Japan, Belgium, Canada, and Australia, plus groups including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, World Economic Forum, Medical Research Future Fund, and European Commission.

Ethiopia detects malaria-carrying mosquito for first time

For the first time, researchers have detected Anopheles stephensi—a mosquito capable of transmitting malaria and normally found in the Middle East, Indian subcontinent, and China—in Ethiopia.

""If these mosquitoes carry malaria, we may see an emergence of malaria in new regions,"" said lead study author Tamar Carter, PhD, assistant professor of tropical disease biology at Baylor University, in a Baylor news release. Carter and her team conducted the genetic analysis on the mosquito, and their work is published in the journal Acta Tropica.

The mosquitoes were collected in breeding sites in late 2016 in Kebri Dehar, a city in Ethiopia's semi-arid eastern region. In a phylogenetic analysis, the researchers found the insects to be part of a distinct clade with a sister isolate from Pakistan, possibly suggesting a novel introduction of the species into the Horn of Africa.

""To gain better insight into the geographic range of An. stephensi, the next step is to conduct mosquito surveys in multiple locations throughout Ethiopia,"" the authors wrote.

According to the World Malaria Report of 2017, more than 68 % of Ethiopia's population is at risk for malaria, with an average of 2.5 million cases reported annually. The dominant mosquito strain that carries the disease in Ethiopia is Anopheles arabiensis.

17-Jan-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to respond to the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in one of the most complex settings possible. A high number of cases are still being reported, most notably from the metropolitan areas of Katwa Health Zone during the past week. The decline in case incidence has continued in Beni; a positive indication of how effective the response can be despite multiple challenges.

Trends in the number of new cases occurring (Figure 1) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across a number of geographically dispersed areas. During the last 21 days (26 December 2018 through 15 January 2019), 79 new cases have been reported from 11 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (36), Oicha (14), Butembo (11), Beni (4), Mabalako (4), Kalungata (3), Kyondo (3), Komanda (1), Musienene (1), Biena (1) and Manguredjipa (1). The latter is a newly affected health zone, although the case likely acquired the infection in Mabalako Health Zone.

As of 15 January 2019, there have been a total of 663 EVD cases 1(614 confirmed and 49 probable), including 407 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 61%). Thus far, 237 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) and enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors. Among confirmed and probable cases with age and sex reported, 59% (391/661) were female and 30% (200/658) were children less than 18 years. This includes a high number of cases in infants aged less than one year (43) and 1-4 years (61).

All alerts in affected areas, in other provinces, and in neighbouring countries continue to be monitored and investigated. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and Rwanda. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside the outbreak affected areas.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO reviewed its risk assessment for the outbreak and the risk remains very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

""This is the most complicated setting we've ever experienced in order to stop an Ebola outbreak,"" said Salama. ""At a minimum, it will take six further months to stop.""

Salama made the sobering prediction alongside some promising developments, including a decrease of cases in Beni, the most active outbreak hot spot, which hasn't seen any new cases in nearly 2 weeks.

""If we can control the outbreak in Beni, we can do it anywhere,"" Salama said. Now, the focus is on Butembo and Katwa, areas with nearly 1 million people. Other hot spots include Komanda and Oicha, but Salama said case loads are lighter there.

""I feel we will be able to get on top of those with access, which will leave Butembo and Katwa as the main priority,"" said Salama.

The outbreak, which began in August in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, has been marred by community resistance, population movement, violence against heath workers, and political instability. These factors have limited the response efforts at times and have allowed the disease to continue to take hold of communities.

""Though this is the 10th outbreak in the DRC, this is a community and region that has never seen Ebola. There was no baseline knowledge among healthcare workers of in the community about the disease,"" said Salama.

100 workers recently added

The WHO now has 450 personnel working in DRC on the outbreak, with 100 of the workers added just in the last month, Salama said.

""This is a massive deployment, but people with the ability and willingness to deploy aren't exactly growing on trees,"" he said.

The instability and danger is one factor limiting more healthcare workers from the outbreak zone, while another is language, as fluency in both French and Swahili is most useful.

While human resources have stretched during the outbreak, Salama said doses of Merck's unlicensed VSV-EBOV vaccine and in-field Ebola testing kits are in good supply.

""Merck has 300,000 doses in the global supply, and we've used about 60,000 so far, so we have some buffer,"" he said. The goal is to have two licensed vaccine products in the global stockpile by 2020, because that would assist with vaccine production ramp-up.

""Were the outbreak to become a multi-country outbreak, then we would quickly face critical vaccine shortages,"" said Salama.

Why the high rates in children?

Salama also shared a working hypothesis he and WHO team members developed to explain the high proportion of cases in young children, those under 5 and under 1 year, during this outbreak.

""There are an enormous number of informal health facilities in Beni, Butembo and Katwa. In Beni [there are] around 400 that are not regulated and had never been mapped, so no one could have told you how many there were, where they were, who staffed them, or what kind of services they supplied,"" Salama said.

These facilities are known locally as ""tradi-moderns,"" or traditional-modern health centers. They are private businesses, and employees do not need any medical licenses or certificates.

""We believe they had a tremendous impact on transmission,"" Salama said. ""We saw in November a trend of children being infected, and we were able to detect cases associated with a relatively small number of facilities.""

The Ebola infections occurred at the same time of a malaria outbreak.

""Unbeknownst to anyone, children were sharing rooms with Ebola patients who were not suspected or diagnosed, and there were no medical records taken,"" Salama said.

Case totals rise to 668, with 410 deaths

According to today's daily update from the DRC's ministry of health, the outbreak has grown to 668 cases and 410 deaths, with 136 cases still under investigation, up from 123 yesterday. Of the 5 newly confirmed cases, 3 are in Kayina, with 1 each in Katwa and Mangurujipa.

Kayina is the 18th health district involved in this outbreak, and the site of two community deaths. The DRC said the cases in Kayina are family members.

As of today, 61,201 people have been vaccinated , including 19,990 in Beni, 12,815 in Katwa, 6,796 in Butembo, 5,741 in Mabalako, 2,433 in Kalunguta, and 2,080 in Komanda.

Jan 17 DRC update",no result found,no result found,"DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - About two-thirds of patients in Congo’s latest Ebola outbreak have been women, the World Health Organization said on Thursday, calling for more focus on gender in disease control and prevention.

The outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo is the world’s second largest and has infected 663 people so far, killing 407, according to health ministry data.

In past Ebola outbreaks, including the largest which killed 11,300 people in West Africa in 2014-2016, the proportion of women and men affected was roughly equal, WHO experts said. This is the 10th outbreak recorded in Congo.

“This is unexpected,” said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, calling for more research.

“It shows the role of women needs to be taken into account right from the get-go,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Congo is a vast country where social roles vary significantly by region. In the North Kivu province fighting Ebola, women are leaders and often heads of households, said Julienne Anoko, a social anthropologist working for WHO.

They are the ones who care for the sick, take them to the hospital if needed, and prepare bodies for burial, all of which expose them to greater risk of infection, she said.

Girls often help their mothers with these tasks, and have also been infected at higher rates than boys, she added.

Ebola spreads through contact with bodily fluids and causes hemorrhagic fever with severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding.

“Women have lots of social power. They take care of the whole community,” Anoko told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

This contrasts with other countries that have battled Ebola, such as Guinea and Sierra Leone, where it is more common for men to accompany family members to hospital, she said.

The part of Congo where Ebola has struck this time is an active conflict zone, where health workers have had to dodge bullets and been confronted by armed groups. A disputed election has stoked further fear and unrest.

Many women have been mistrustful of male responders, but WHO has started to see success in spreading messages about the disease through local female leaders, said Anoko.

“We need to increase the involvement of women,” she said.

WHO Africa director Moeti, the first woman to hold that position, said gender should play a bigger role in data analysis for outbreaks of all infectious diseases.

“I think we really need to take this into account as a core part of our work on outbreak responses,” she said.",no result found

Ebola infections have been confirmed in 12 more people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), including 6 in Katwa, one of the more recent hot spots, the country's health ministry said today.

The other cases include two from Butembo and one each from Musienene, Kyondo, Beni, and Kayina, which is the newest affected health zone. The illnesses push the outbreak total to 680 cases, including 631 confirmed and 49 probable illnesses. Outbreak responders are still following up on 209 suspected Ebola cases, up from 136 yesterday.

Four more patients died from their infections, three of them in community settings in hard-hit Katwa. The other occurred in a hospital in Beni. The developments lift the fatality count to 414.

In other outbreak developments, a new Ebola treatment center, the ninth in the region, and a laboratory opened in Ituri province yesterday with the goal of isolating, testing, and treating confirmed and suspected Ebola patients in Komanda health zone and surrounding areas.

Experts say pandemics will cost $570 billion a year in coming decades

In a World Economic Forum (WEF) report released today, economists estimate that pandemics and infectious disease outbreaks in the coming decades will cause annual economic losses of 0.7% of global gross domestic product (GDP) on average—a threat similar to that of climate change—and suggest globalization has magnified the economic impact.

That equals about $570 billion in losses each year.

Since 2011, the report notes, the world has experienced an average of 200 epidemic events a year, and the number and type of outbreaks have increased significantly in recent decades and will likely increase even more. While potentially catastrophic outbreaks may occur only every few decades, highly disruptive regional and local outbreaks are becoming more common and pose a major threat to lives and businesses, the authors say.

The report synthesizes the effects that outbreaks have on employees, supply chains, customers, travel and tourism, and other business-related factors—as well as the impact globalization has had on elevating the economic risk. ""The world remains ill-prepared to detect and respond to outbreaks and is not prepared to respond to a significant pandemic threat,"" the report notes. And its expert authors add, ""Multinational corporations will increasingly rely on the often relatively weak public health and disease control infrastructure in these countries to avoid outbreak-related economic disruption.""

But the authors also note that, while infectious disease threats are inevitable, the economic damage they cause is not. They recommend a ""holistic"" approach to preparedness that includes reducing corporate exposure, improving response capabilities, and communicating proactively.

The authors conclude, ""Billions of dollars and millions of lives and livelihoods depend on the business community’s collective response to the changing threat of epidemics. Better corporate citizenship towards such threats enables companies to deliver substantial shareholder and social value at the same time.""

BARDA exercises option for freeze-dried smallpox vaccine

The US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) has exercised a contract option worth $44 million with Bavarian Nordic to support production of its freeze-dried MVA-BN smallpox vaccine, the company announced today.

The funding will cover qualification of Bavarian Nordic's new fill-and-finish facility at its Denmark headquarters and transfer and validate the freeze-drying process. The option is the second to be exercised under the contract and follows the 2017 option of $37 million for a phase 3 study, expected to begin in the first half of this year, that is needed to apply for approval.

Paul Chaplin, Bavarian Nordic's president and chief executive officer, said in the statement that the option will support the final steps to bringing the facility into operation, ""and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership with BARDA in the development and production of biological countermeasures to protect the U.S. population."" The plant will be able to produce 40 million doses of liquid vaccine and 8 million of freeze-dried vaccine each year.

Since 2010, Bavarian Nordic has made 28 million doses of liquid-frozen MVA-BN smallpox vaccine for the US Strategic National Stockpile. The freeze-dried version is designed to provide a longer shelf life and replace expired stockpile doses.

Pakistan, Nigeria record new polio cases at end of 2018

According to the latest update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) today, both Pakistan and Nigeria recently confirmed polio cases that occurred at the end of 2018.

Pakistan officials noted two cases of wild poliovirus type 1, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Bajour Agency in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Patients experienced an onset of paralysis on Dec 16 and 25, respectively. The cases raises Pakistan's wild poliovirus case count for 2018 to 10.

In Nigeria, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) case was recorded in Kwara state, close to the Benin border. The patient experienced symptom onset on Dec 5. The infection lifts Nigeria's 2018 number of cVDPV2 cases to 33.

""The country continues to be affected by two separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the first centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the second in Sokoto state,"" the GPEI said.

So far in 2019, no countries have recorded polio cases.

Nearly 20,000 measles cases recorded in Madagascar since October

Yesterday the World Health Organization (WHO) described an unusually large measles outbreak in Madagascar, which has resulted in 19,539 cases and 39 deaths since Oct 4, 2018.

""Madagascar last experienced measles outbreaks in 2003 and 2004, with reported number of cases at 62,233 and 35,558, respectively. Since then, the number of reported cases had sharply declined until the current outbreak,"" the WHO said.

Cases have been reported in all 22 regions of Madagascar, including densely populated cities such as Toamasina, Mahajanga, Antsirabe, Toliara, and the capital city, Antananarivo.

Children ages 1 to 14 years account for 64% of cases, and 51% of patients have not been vaccinated against the disease, or have unknown vaccination status. According to the WHO, the estimated measles immunization coverage in Madagascar was 58% in 2017.

The agency said the outbreak is occurring at the same time plague has made a resurgence in Madagascar, stretching public health resources. The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar is conducting vaccination campaigns in the hardest-hit communities.

Washington state sees 16 measles cases as NJ declares end to outbreak

Yesterday health officials in Clark County, Washington, confirmed 16 cases of measles, 14 of which occurred in unvaccinated minors since Jan 1.

According to a press release, 13 of the cases occurred in children under the age of 10, and the other 3 cases occurred in kids ages 10 to 18. Several healthcare facilties and schools are listed as possible exposure sites. At this time, it is unclear if the cases are connected. Five additional cases are suspected.

""Clark County Public Health is urging anyone who has been exposed and believes they have symptoms of measles to call their health care provider prior to visiting the medical office to make a plan that avoids exposing others in the waiting room,"" officials said in a press release.

In other domestic measles news, health officials in Ocean County, New Jersey, said a measles outbreak in that state is officially over as no new cases have been recorded in the past 42 days. A total of 33 people were infected in the outbreak.

New York City officials, meanwhile, have confirmed 58 measles cases of measles in an Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn since October. The outbreak began when an unvaccinated child contracted the disease during a trip to Israel.

The Borough Park neighborhood has been hardest hit, with 35 cases, including 3 diagnosed in the last week. Officials in New York urge anyone traveling to Israel to get vaccinated with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine at least two weeks prior to their trip.

Over the course of the outbreak, responders have been grappling with evolving challenges in different areas. In today's update, the health ministry described a security incident at a health checkpoint in Komanda that injured two workers.

Katwa resistance fuels case spike

Of the 19 new cases reported Jan 19 through today, 14 are in Katwa, 2 in Vuhovi, and 1 each in Beni, Mabalako, and Oicha. The new illnesses lift the outbreak total to 699, which includes 650 confirmed and 49 probable cases. As of today, authorities are still investigating 252 suspected cases.

In its Jan 19 update, the ministry said Katwa and Butembo are current hot spots, responsible for 65% of the new cases confirmed over the past 21 days. In Katwa, responders are encountering resistance from relatives of patients with confirmed infections. For example, reluctant contacts are refusing vaccination and follow-up, and the last 10 confirmed case-patients in Katwa are in the Muchanga health area and have family or neighborhood links.

In the former outbreak epicenter of Beni, cases have declined dramatically, but the newly reported case from the city involves a 19-day-old baby of a mother whose illness was reported on Jan 18.

Alongside the steady rise in new cases, the health ministry said 19 more people have died from Ebola, including 10 from Katwa, 5 from Butembo, 3 from Beni, and 1 from Mabalako. Of the 19 deaths, 8 occurred in the community, including 7 from Katwa and 1 from Mabalako.

The latest deaths push the outbreak's overall fatality count to 433.

Security incident in Komanda

In its update today, the health ministry reported a Jan 20 clash between a motorcyclist and health workers at a health checkpoint in Komanda health zone, one of the four affected areas of Ituri province .

The incident began when the motorcyclist refused to wash his hands and have his temperature taken, then tried to attack the health workers, prompting police officers to arrest him.

Then in protest, a group of bikers attacked the checkpoint, which also serves as the coordinating office for Komanda's Ebola response. The ministry said the police intervened quickly, limiting property damage to a few broken chairs and resulting in slight injury to two responders.

Earlier this month, violence in Komanda injured a member of the health ministry vaccination team.

Recent cases in 13 health zones

In its latest weekly update on emergencies and outbreaks, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office detailed the size and scope of the outbreak, noting that, of 18 affected health zones, 13 have reported at least one new confirmed case over the past 21 days.

Aside from the Katwa and Butembo hot spots, the WHO said Oicha is a third hot spot where resistance and insecurity pose significant challenges for outbreak responders.

The agency also noted that the newly affected health zone Kanya is located on the national road to Goma, the capital of North Kivu province. Also, it said the number of health workers sickened in the outbreak remained at 56 cases, 18 of them fatal.

A spot of good news in an Ebola crisis: Vaccine supplies are expected to last

There’s some good news related to an Ebola crisis that has offered very little up until now. The World Health Organization now predicts there are adequate supplies of an experimental Ebola vaccine to control the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

“I believe we will have enough vaccine to stop this outbreak unless something very dramatic changes,” Dr. Peter Salama, WHO’s deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response, told STAT.

And while an ongoing clinical trial of the vaccine may not be complete for some time, preliminary analyses suggest it is working.

advertisement

Salama said the evidence the WHO has been gathering in North Kivu — where nearly 64,000 doses have been administered — point to the vaccine being “highly, highly efficacious.” That conclusion, he said, is based on how the vaccine has performed in the people who have received it, on three modeling studies, and on an earlier study of the vaccine conducted in West Africa.

“So a lot of pieces of evidence that point in absolutely the same direction,” Salama said.

Newsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:

The vaccine is known by a provisional name, V920, and is made by Merck. It was first shown to be protective in people in a l andmark clinical trial in Guinea toward the end of the massive West African Ebola crisis of 2014-2016.

That study tested the vaccine in an approach that is being used in the current outbreak, a ring-vaccination strategy. People who have been in contact with a case — and then all of their contacts — are offered vaccine. People on the front lines of the response — health workers, people who conduct safe burials — are also offered the chance to be vaccinated.

Salama said the vaccine efficacy rate in the current outbreak is well above 90 percent. He acknowledged there have been a few infections in people who were vaccinated, but said the number — which he declined to specify — is low. “There are very few breakthrough cases,” he said.

Salama credits the vaccine for the fact that transmission at Beni — a major hot spot for several months — appears to be coming under control, even though the outbreak response teams have had a difficult time there tracing the chains of transmission and recurring violence has hampered their efforts.

This outbreak, which is the second largest on record, marks only the second time a vaccine has been used essentially from the start of an Ebola epidemic. The first was in a smaller outbreak in western DRC in the spring.

As of Monday, there have been 689 confirmed and probable infections in this outbreak and 422 deaths.

Merck began filing documents for its licensure bid with the Food and Drug Administration in late 2018 and expects to apply to the European Medicines Agency for licensure in 2019, said Beth-Ann Coller, the company’s team leader for the vaccine project.

In an agreement forged with the WHO and with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, after the West African outbreak, Merck committed to maintaining a stockpile of 300,000 doses of the vaccine at all times while it was working to get the product licensed.

Merck has donated the vaccine to the WHO and the Congolese Ministry of Health.

Until this outbreak, the size of the stockpile seemed more than adequate; historically most Ebola epidemics have been controlled after fewer than 100 cases. But as the dangerous and challenging outbreak in DRC’s North Kivu province has dragged on, and the number of vaccine doses used has climbed into the tens of thousands, concerns have arisen that the company might run out of supply.

The WHO has already indicated the size of the Ebola vaccine stockpile must be revisited.

It takes a year to make a batch of the vaccine, from ordering the ingredients to capping filled multidose vials, Coller explained.

Even though the company has sent 100,000 doses of the vaccine so far to the WHO, it still has on hand about 300,000 doses in vials and in bulk, Coller said. Converting bulk vaccine to vials that are ready to ship takes four or five months, she said.

Merck has been working to replenish the supplies as WHO has drawn down on the stockpile. It has been helped in that by a quirk in timing.

The company started building up the Ebola vaccine stockpile in 2015 and 2016. Recognizing that some of the earliest stock would be coming up to its expiry date, Merck began making fresh supplies about a year ago.

Those earlier doses did not expire — they were used in North Kivu, Coller said. And that move to top up the supply means the stockpile is still holding at about its 300,000-dose set point.

“Based on uncertainty around the outbreak, we’re also exploring options to even expand upon that and to potentially kick in additional manufacturing that was frankly not planned as part of our normal replenishment effort,” Coller said."

Officials are still investigating 203 cases.

Of the newly confirmed cases, 9 were recorded in Katwa, 2 in Mangurujipa, and 1 each in Biena, Butembo, and Kayina. Among 6 newly recorded deaths, 4 took place in the community, which increases the risk of transmission.

Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its latest situation report on the outbreak. The WHO notes that 13 of 18 health zones identified in the outbreak are active, meaning there has been at least 1 confirmed case recorded in the past 21 days.

""Trends in case incidence reflect the continuation of the outbreak across a geographically widely dispersed area with a decline in the number of cases in Beni and increase of reported cases, especially in Katwa,"" the WHO said.

WHO: 15% of cases in young kids

The WHO situation report included updated information about the number of children infected in this outbreak, as cases among newborns and pregnant women are still being recorded. Roughly 6% of cases have occurred in children under the age of 1, and 15% under the age of 5.

Women make up 62% of patients, a high rate but not uncommon in Ebola outbreaks. In an interview with CIDRAP last week, Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said women often attend funerals more than men and tend to care for children and other sick family members, making them more at risk for transmission.

The case-fatality rate among confirmed cases is 59%, a number that drops to 38% among confirmed cases who are hospitalized at an Ebola treatment center, the WHO said.

The WHO said screening continues at points of entry surrounding North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

As of Jan 20, the WHO said more than 27 million traveler screenings had been carried out at 78 points of entry, resulting in 175 alerts and 4 suspect cases later confirmed as Ebola cases.

Contact tracing, vaccination continue

Contact tracing also continues, with approximately 42,500 contacts registered to date and 5,514 currently under surveillance. At least 75% of those contacts have been followed in the past week.

According to the DRC, as of today, 65,172 people have been vaccinated in an ongoing ring vaccination campaign with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine, including 20,140 in Beni, 14,456 in Katwa, and 7,454 in Butembo.

On Twitter today, Salama said the WHO was consulting today on study designs meant to generate evidence for other candidate Ebola vaccines. The consultation is hosted by the Wellcome Trust.

The epidemic in a volatile part of the DRC is the second worst ever, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The largest outbreak occurred between 2013-2016 in West Africa. More than 28,000 cases were confirmed.

24-Jan-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners have continued to face challenges in the containment and control of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The number of reported cases increased during recent weeks, most notably from the Katwa health zone where response teams have faced pockets of community mistrust. The outbreak has also extended southwards to Kayina health zone, a high security risk area. Teams are working actively to build community trust and scale up response activities around these new clusters.

Figure 1 shows that as of 22 January 2019, there have been a total of 713 EVD cases1 (664 confirmed and 49 probable), including 439 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 62%). Thus far, 247 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs), with many having enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors. Among cases with a reported age and sex, 59% (420/710) of cases were female, and 30% (214/708) were aged less than 18 years; including 108 infants and children under 5 years. Sixty-one healthcare workers have been infected to date.

During the last 21 days (2 January – 22 January 2019), 102 new cases have been reported from 13 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (62), Butembo (12), Oicha (6), Kayina (5), Beni (2), Manguredjipa (3), Kyondo (3), Kalungata (2), Komanda (1), Musienene (2), Biena (2), Mabalako (1), and Vuhovi (1). The current outbreak hotspots of Butembo and Katwa encompass an urban area with a population of approximately one million people. Of the 148 cases reported in Katwa to date, less than half (55/148) were registered as contacts at the time of illness onset. Moreover, 10% (14/148) of these cases comprised of healthcare workers, and among those with available information, 42% (45/107) reported having attended a funeral in the weeks prior to illness onset. Collectively, these figures suggest that the observed increase in Katwa is being driven by a combination of both healthcare facility and community-based transmissions. Health protection and control measures such as infection prevention and control in health centers, vaccination for healthcare and other frontline workers, and safe and dignified burial practices, are being strengthened to interrupt the chains of transmission.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordination, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO reviewed its risk assessment for the outbreak and the risk remains very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. This outbreak of EVD is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Also, the DRC media reported another security incident in the outbreak region, and researchers published new findings on clinical patterns and health worker vaccination from studies conducted in Sierra Leone during its outbreak in 2014-16.

Cases continue in Katwa hot spot

The DRC's health ministry today said two of the latest patients are from Katwa, one of the latest outbreak hot spots located just southeast of Butembo, and Biena health zone, which is west of Butembo.

The illnesses bring the overall outbreak total to 715, but the ministry noted that it has removed a duplicate case from Mabalako from its count. The number includes 666 confirmed and 49 probable cases.

Health officials are still investigating 236 suspected cases, and teams have now immunized 65,963 people with the Merck's unlicensed VSV-EBOV vaccine.

Also, the ministry said 4 more people died from their infections, including a patient from Biena who died in the community setting and 3 who died in Ebola treatment centers—2 in Butembo and 1 in Katwa. So far 443 deaths have been reported in the DRC outbreak.

In Beni, which was the main Ebola hot spot but has recently shown a steep drop in cases, a group of people vandalized a local hospital the night of Jan 21, apparently targeting Ebola responders that they thought were inside, according to a translation of a local media report.

The attackers threatened to burn the facility and destroyed the door and windows before they were scared off, the report said. A nurse quoted in the story said the facility had hosted Ebola vaccinators, that they felt safe there, and that she welcomed their help in fighting the epidemic.

Bat findings provide more reservoir clues

Liberia's government and its partners, which include Center for Infection and Immunity (CII) at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and EcoHealth Alliance, announced the bat findings today in a press release.

As part of bat sampling with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) PREDICT project, scientists found Ebola genetic material and Ebola antibodies in a greater long-fingered bat from Nimba district in northeastern Liberia, according to a press release from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. The project also included researchers from Columbia's Center for Infection and Immunity and EcoHealth Alliance.

The bat species that yielded Ebola evidence is found in West Africa and other regions and is important to agriculture, because they eat insects that damage crops. Unlike other bats, the long-fingered type doesn't roost in homes or building and instead are found in forests, caves, and mines. According to the report, Liberia's government is using that information to teach the public about how to avoid exposure and increase their awareness of the animals' positive impact on the environment.

Evidence from 20% of the bat's genome suggests that it is closely related to the Zaire Ebola virus species, which was involved in West Africa's massive 2014-16 outbreak and is also implicated in the current DRC outbreak. Researchers at CII are trying to determine if the strain from the bat is a genetic match with the one that caused West Africa's outbreak.

The researchers said the finding brings scientists closer to understanding the source of Ebola in humans.

Simon Anthony, DPhil, assistant professor of epidemiology at CII, said in the release that there has been speculation that Ebola in humans came from bats, but no direct evidence has yet been found. ""It is possible that there are also other bat species that carry Ebola. Going forward, we will be analyzing additional specimens to fill in the picture,"" he said.

According to a news report on the discovery in Science today, two other Ebola species were found in a related insect-eating bat, but other indications have pointed to fruit bats as a possible reservoir. Jon Epstein, DVM, with EcoHealth Alliance and who leads the USAID-PREDICT project in Liberia, told Science that the new finding hints at the possibility that Ebola has multiple hosts that may vary by region.

Another researcher not involved in the work, Fabian Leendertz, DVM, with the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, told Science that a next step would be to sample the insects that the bats eat to see if they harbor the virus.

Studies on kids' infections, health worker vaccination

In other Ebola research developments, scientists reported new findings related to clinical disease in kids and vaccination in health workers, both based on experiences in Sierra Leone's outbreak:

A review of clinical disease and treatment outcomes in 139 patients younger than 15 years found that 56.1% were girls and 51.1% were students and that certain factors at the time of admission were associated with greater odds of dying from the disease, according to the report today in BMC Infectious Diseases. The factors included male gender, abdominal pain, vomiting, conjunctivitis, and difficulty breathing.





A 2018 survey on staff turnover and Ebola vaccine acceptance in 305 health workers in Sierra Leone found that 76% of them had a positive opinion of Ebola vaccination and that vaccination against Ebola is feasible if employment is stable, but repeated vaccination at the start of employment may be needed to maintain high vaccination coverage. Researchers reported their findings yesterday in Vaccine.

Jan 23 Vaccine abstract",no result found,no result found,"DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Dozens of Congolese Ebola survivors are dispelling rumors and caring for patients and lone children in the world’s second deadliest outbreak, health workers said on Thursday.

The virus is spreading fast in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, with 713 confirmed and probable cases and 439 deaths. It is surpassed only by the 2014 to 2016 outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, in which more than 11,000 people died.

Nearly 250 patients in Congo have recovered since the outbreak began in July. Research has shown the disease gives survivors immunity.

“I like this work very much,” said Lydie Besolo, an 18-year-old in the town of Beni who survived Ebola and now spends her afternoons after school working as a nurse in a health center run by medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).

“I tell (the patients) my story. It helps them,” she said, adding that she hopes to be a doctor someday.

Health workers say one of the biggest challenges in this outbreak has been dispelling rumors about the disease. Suspicious of foreign intervention and political plots, locals have attacked volunteers and refused vaccines.

Ebola struck during a politically tense period in Congo, ahead of December’s election to end President Joseph Kabila’s 17-year rule.

The electoral commission at the last minute canceled voting in Beni and other Ebola-stricken areas, which are opposition strongholds.

“I tell them that it’s not politics, it’s a real disease,” said Modeste Kasereka Kikopo, 26, a survivor who works in the MSF center as an electrician and helps spread awareness.

The charity said that about 20 survivors work in its center in Beni, mostly looking after patients.

Twelve survivors work in a nursery for children who have been separated from their parents, said the United Nations children’s agency (UNICEF), while up to 40 survivors are part of community engagement efforts run by the Red Cross.

“Ebola survivors are a critical entry point to build trust in the community,” said Jamie LeSueur, head of operations for the Ebola response for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

“Having someone go through this horrible experience and come out alive shows people that they can survive the disease and that we are there to support communities, not harm them,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.",no result found

Derived from the blood of a person who survived an Ebola infection in 1995, mAB114 is an antibody that in earlier studies provided full protection against Ebola in animals, including non-human primates.

Study involved 18 adults

The phase 1 study conducted by researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), looked at how infusions of mAB114 performed in 18 healthy adults ages 18 to 60 who were divided into three groups: 3 (17%) were given 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of mAb114, 5 (28%) were given 25 mg/kg, and 10 (55%) were given 50 mg/kg.

No adverse events were reported, and no fevers were associated with infusions at any dose. Four participants reported mild reactions in the 3 days following administration of the drug, all of which resolved within 1 to 4 days.

The authors said mAB114 is the only current Ebola treatment in testing or development derived from a human survivor of the virus, and the single infusion dosing of the antibody makes it an attractive treatment in an outbreak environment. The medicine also comes in a reconstituted powder formulation that does not require refrigeration.

""The pharmacokinetic profile of mAb114 shows dose-dependent linearity, low variability between participants within a given dose, and is consistent with the pharmacokinetic profile of non-human primates receiving protective antibody doses,"" the authors concluded.

On Aug 10, 2018, the DRC government received mAb114 for compassionate use as a single-infusion intravenous dose of 50 mg/kg.

mAb114 is also one of three therapies being administered as part of a randomized controlled trial that began in November 2018 in the DRC comparing mortality rates among recipients of ZMapp, mAB114, and the antiviral drug remdesivir.

Six more cases in Katwa

In its daily update, officials from the DRC confirmed 6 new cases in the ongoing outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Outbreak totals now stand at 721, including 446 deaths. A total of 204 cases are still under investigation.

All of the newly confirmed cases originated in Katwa, a hot spot of activity in recent weeks. Three new deaths were also reported in Katwa, including 2 community deaths, which occur outside of Ebola treatment centers or hospitals and raise the risk of disease spread.

The DRC said 66,861 people have been vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine as of today, including 20,183 in Beni, 15,243 in Katwa, and 7,494 in Butembo.

Yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a statement on the outbreak and shared worrisome details on the high percentage of cases in Katwa that occur among people not known to have contact with Ebola patients.

""Of the 148 cases reported in Katwa to date, less than half (55/148) were registered as contacts at the time of illness onset. Moreover, 10% (14/148) of these cases comprised of healthcare workers, and among those with available information, 42% (45/107) reported having attended a funeral in the weeks prior to illness onset,"" the WHO said.

""Collectively, these figures suggest that the observed increase in Katwa is being driven by a combination of both healthcare facility and community-based transmissions.""

Sixty-one healthcare workers have been infected to date, the WHO said.

Jan 24 WHO update",no result found,no result found,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo’s Ebola outbreak has spread southwards into an area with high security risks, the World Health Organization said.

The outbreak, the country’s worst, has killed 439 of the 713 people believed to have caught the disease. The fight against Ebola depends on tracing people who may have had contact with the disease and could fall ill and spread it further.

But the outbreak in a region of Congo with frequent fighting makes it hard for health workers to move around and monitor potential sufferers and to spread messages about how to avoid becoming sick.

Most of the cases since the start of the year have been in Katwa health zone, where the WHO said Ebola workers had faced “pockets of community mistrust” and most people falling ill were not on lists of people suspected of coming into contact with Ebola.

“The outbreak has also extended southwards to Kayina health zone, a high security risk area,” the WHO said in its statement late on Thursday. There have been five cases in Kayina, which lies between the main outbreak zone and the major city of Goma, which is close to the Rwandan border.

The WHO said that after running an Ebola simulation exercise in Rwanda, it was sending a team to beef up the country’s preparedness and to vaccinate health workers who would be first to come into contact with Ebola if it spread across the border.

However, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said there had also been a decline in cases around the previous hotspot Beni.

“It is very premature to shout victory, it’s true we had some success in Beni because all the steps we’ve taken have had an impact, but unfortunately we see cases turning up in other areas,” she said.

“The country is not only facing Ebola but other health threats, just to name malaria, cholera, vaccine-derived polio, and also a very long humanitarian crisis and a lot of violence in several regions.”

More than 60,000 people have been vaccinated in Congo, as well as 2,500 in Uganda, one of the countries at “very high” risk from the disease.

Also, the country's health ministry shed more light today on factors that have fueled a steep rise in cases in Katwa, which has become the current hot spot, and South Sudan today launched a campaign to immunize health workers and frontline responders with VSV-EBOV vaccine.

Case count climbs to 736

In the latest three daily updates, the latest cases were from a several locations. Of the 10 confirmed cases, 4 are in Beni, an area where cases have declined but was once the outbreak's epicenter. Two others are in Oicha, and four are in Katwa, the current hot spot.

The five probable cases in Komanda were added after investigations into deaths that occurred in November and December concluded that they were likely due to Ebola.

The new cases boost the overall outbreak total to 736 cases, which include 682 confirmed and 54 probable infections. In its update today, the ministry said health officials are still investigating 161 suspected Ebola cases.

Besides the 5 deaths in the earlier probable cases, the health ministry reported 8 more deaths, including 7 patients from Ebola treatment centers in Katwa, Butembo, and Mabalako. One of the deaths involved a patient from Oicha who died in the community.

The latest deaths push the outbreak's overall fatality count to 459.

Disruptions, reluctance in Katwa

In its update today, the DRC's health ministry said several factors have led to a significant increase in cases in Katwa this month, including local groups that have obstructed response activities such as immunization, household decontamination, and safe and dignified burials.

And despite broad community sensitization efforts, many Katwa residents continue to deny that Ebola exists, the ministry said. It added, ""However, significant progress in community involvement in Katwa has been achieved, in particular through greater involvement of women's associations.""

Also, demonstrations related to problems with the DRC's national election in late December brought the outbreak response to a standstill for several days, the ministry said, which resulted in a large drop in Ebola alerts that officials received and investigated. As a result, people with Ebola weren't quickly taken to Ebola treatment centers for care, and contacts weren't vaccinated.

Several ""dead"" days since the beginning of the year in Butembo and Katwa have also slowed the Ebola response. ""When the response is slow, the risk of geographical expansion of the epidemic increases due to uncontrolled displacement of patients and their contacts,"" it said.

After the response interruptions, people who were contacts of confirmed cases moved and brought the virus to two new health zones in January: Mangurujipa and Kayina. And investigators found that Kayina's confirmed case-patients are members of a Katwa family who participated in the unsafe burial of a relative. Infections have been confirmed in 21 family members.

Officials push back against assertions

In an unusual step, the health ministry in its Jan 26 update disputed some information in a Jan 15 Foreign Policy article that discussed the challenges in the DRC's outbreak.

It said the article contained some ""dubious and problematic"" assertions, for example, that the health workers were threatened by soldiers, gangs, arms smugglers, and rapists. The health ministry clarified that most assaults and threats on responders have come from people the residents of Ebola-affected communities. It added that several Ebola cases have been detected in areas controlled by armed groups that have agreed to work with response teams to curb the outbreak.

The health ministry also said the article inappropriately linked possible sexual transmission in survivors and the use of rape as a weapon of war. It said no cases of ""military rape or rape contamination"" have been reported in outbreak areas and that there is no objective evidence to back up the assumption that ""rapist and robber soldiers"" could spread the virus.

The ministry said Ebola survivors and their families are being followed by clinical psychologists and that so far rape has not been mentioned as a source of trauma in populations affected by the outbreak.

South Sudan vaccine launch

In South Sudan, which has a border not far from the DRC's outbreak area, the health ministry and its partners today began vaccinating health workers and frontline responders against Ebola as part of larger preparedness efforts, according to a statement today from the World Health Organization (WHO) South Sudan office. Groups supporting the efforts include the WHO; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; UNICEF; and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Vaccination began in Yambio in Gbudue state, and health workers in the cities of Tombura, Yei, Nimule, and South Sudan's capital city of Juba—all considered high-risk areas—will also be offered the vaccine.

The country has received 2,160 doses of VSV-EBOV from Merck.

Matshidiso Moeti, MD, the WHO's regional director for Africa, said in the statement, ""It is absolutely vital that we are prepared for any potential case of Ebola spreading beyond the Democratic Republic of the Congo."" The WHO said it has deployed more than 30 staff members to support preparedness efforts in South Sudan, has helped train 60 health workers, and established 17 screening points that have screened nearly 1 million people so far.

Gavi has assisted with the Ebola vaccine stockpile and has provided $2 million to support WHO vaccination efforts in countries that neighbor the DRC's Ebola-affected area.

In November, health officials launched a similar vaccination campaign in Uganda, one of the other neighboring countries.

As of today, 174 cases remain under investigation, which is up from 161 yesterday.

Four of the new cases were reported in Katwa, the latest hot spot in the outbreak that has swept across North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the DRC during the past 6 months.

One of the two deaths confirmed today was a community death in Katwa. Community deaths, which take place outside of a hospital or Ebola treatment center, raise the risk of Ebola transmission.

Key role of women

The World Health Organization (WHO) said women play a key role in controlling the outbreak.

Approximately two thirds of patients in the current outbreak are women; historically, infections are split evenly among men and women. But in the eastern DRC, women are more likely than men to attend funerals and care for sick relatives.

In an effort to stop the disease, the WHO said women have been trained in outbreak response and Ebola education and have gone door to door in outbreak zones to inform residents about the deadly disease.

""Local women have taken a leadership role in explaining the disease, and learning how to stop its spread,"" the WHO said.

Vaccination efforts continue

Yesterday, officials from the DRC said they were facing community resistance in Katwa, and said vaccination and surveillance efforts throughout the region have seen fits and starts since the DRC's presidential election in late December.

As of today, 69,231 people have been vaccinated against Ebola using Merck's unlicensed VSV-EBOV vaccine, including 20,221 in Beni, 16,171 in Katwa, 7,860 in Butembo, and 6,008 in Mabalako.

In other vaccine news, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a phase 1 clinical trial that will test two experimental Ebola vaccines in 60 healthy adults. Researchers are conducting the trial at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.

According to a press release from the hospital, the study will look at the ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine and the MVA-BN-Filo vaccine, vaccines employing weakened live vectors that cannot effectively grow in human cells but generate a strong immune response to Ebola virus proteins.

Some participants will receive one vaccine; others will receive both. The trial is expected to last 7 months.

Spike in Katwa cases continues

Of the nine newly confirmed cases announced today by the DRC health ministry, eight are in Katwa, the current hot spot where authorities face complex challenges, including insecurity, community resistance, and the after effects of a response slowdown in late December caused by election-related protests.

The other case is in Beni. Investigations are under way into 187 suspected Ebola cases. Today's developments push the outbreak total to 752 cases, including 698 confirmed and 54 probable cases.

The health ministry also said 4 more people died from their Ebola infections, 3 of them in community settings in Katwa and 1 in the Butembo Ebola treatment center. The new fatalities lift the outbreak's death count to 465.

Infected traveler in Haut Uele province

A health team has been sent to a city of Watsa in neighboring Haut Uele province after a young trader was hospitalized there after his likely exposure in Katwa, the health ministry said in its update today, noting that Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, the country's health minister, arrived there yesterday to oversee operations.

Haut Uele province is north of Ituri province and borders South Sudan. So far, Ebola cases in the current outbreak have been confirmed in only two DRC provinces: North Kivu and Ituri.

The man lives in Watsa but travels back and forth between Butembo and his hometown. An investigation into his illness suggests he was exposed to Ebola during a stay in Katwa, which is on the eastern outskirts of Butembo. Watsa is about 300 miles north of Butembo.

Healthcare teams were sent to vaccinate relatives and frontline health workers and to decontaminate the patient's home and the health center where he was treated.

Soldiers among recent deaths in Beni

In a separate development, two soldiers with the DRC's army have died from Ebola in Beni, Agence-France Presse (AFP) reported today, quoting an army spokesman.

The army source told AFP that three other soldiers are under observation and that steps have been taken to prevent illness in DRC troops.

31-Jan-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to respond to an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD), despite persistent challenges around security and community mistrust impacting response measures. Relatively high numbers of cases were reported in recent weeks (Figure 1), mostly driven by the outbreak in Katwa Health Zone; the current focus of large scale response activities. Smaller clusters continue to be reported beyond Katwa Health Zone, including from Beni and Oicha; however, teams have quickly and systematically responded to these clusters to prevent onward transmission and guard against further geographical expansion of the outbreak. Teams are also working actively to strengthen community trust and participation in all affected areas.

As we approach six months since declaration of the outbreak, there have been a total of 752 EVD cases1 (698 confirmed and 54 probable) reported, including 465 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 62%) as of 29 January 2019. Thus far, 259 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) and enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors. Among cases with a reported age and sex, 59% (439/750) were female, and 30% (224/749) were aged less than 18 years; including 115 children under 5 years.

During the last 21 days (9 January – 29 January 2019), 118 new cases have been reported from 11 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (80), Beni (9), Butembo (7), Kayina (5), Manguredjipa (4), Oicha (4), Biena (3), Kyondo (2), Musienene (2), Komanda (1) and Vuhovi (1). In addition, five historic probable cases from Komanda Health Zone were reported during the past week with illness onset dating back to November 2018.

The outbreak in Katwa and Butembo health zones is partly being driven by nosocomial transmission events in private and public health centres. Since 1 December 2018, 86% (125/145) of cases in these areas had visited or worked in a health care facility before or after their onset of illness. Of those, 21% (30/145) reported contact with a health care facility before their onset of illness, suggesting possible nosocomial transmission. In Katwa during the past 3 weeks (since 9 January), 49 health structures were identified where confirmed cases were hospitalised, including nine health centres where nosocomial transmission potentially occurred. Moreover, during the same period, eight new health care worker (HCW) infections were reported in Katwa; overall, 65 HCWs have been infected to date. Response teams are following up with the identified health care facilities to address gaps around triage, case detection and infection prevention and control measures.

Public health response

The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO reviewed its risk assessment for the outbreak and the risk remains very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. This Ebola virus outbreak is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of Ebola virus at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The vaccine recipients span 28 health zones in four provinces of the DRC, mostly in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, where ring vaccination campaigns began last August. As of today, 70,611 people have been vaccinated, including 20,321 in Beni, 16,657 in Katwa, 7,939 in Butembo, 6,008 in Mabalako, 2,656 in Kalunguta, and 2,110 in Komanda.

Though experts have called the campaign a success, the outbreak shows no signs of slowing. Today, the DRC confirmed 7 new cases, bringing the total number to 759, including 468 deaths.

Nearly 200 cases under investigation

Of the seven new cases, six are in Katwa and one is in Butembo. Katwa is the latest hot spot for Ebola activity, where several cases have been confirmed each day in the past week.

As has been the trend for the past several months, dozens of people—today the number stands at 178—are still under investigation for possible Ebola infections.

There were three new deaths reported by the DRC, including one community death in Katwa and two deaths in Beni and Katwa that took place in an Ebola treatment center (ETC). Deaths in the community—versus in an ETC or hospital—raise the risk of transmission because of added exposure.

The DRC also said a new eight-bed ETC in Kayina opened yesterday. This is the tenth ECT built during this outbreak, and Kayina joins Beni, Bunia, Butembo, Goma, Katwa, Komanda, Mandima, Mangina, and Tchomia in having its own ETC.

Cross-border concerns

Katwa was also at the center of a possible international Ebola incident, when a man and a woman—contacts of confirmed Ebola cases in Katwa—crossed into Uganda through the Kasindi point of entry.

The two people were under daily follow-up in the DRC but managed evade surveillance and cross into Uganda because they did not have any symptoms, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in an update today.

""Uganda's surveillance system immediately swung into action using health workers, security personnel, immigration officers and Village Health Teams (VHTs) among others to look for the duo,"" the WHO said. ""But on 30th January 2019, the two were located in one of the suburbs of Kampala. They were in good health with no signs and symptom for EVD [Ebola virus disease] and they have completed the 21-days mandatory follow-up for all EVD contacts.""

The WHO said the event is a wakeup call that Ebola was just ""a few hours away"" from Kampala or other major cities near the DRC.

And in the latest developments, the country's health ministry announced four new cases, and the WHO expressed sadness over the death of a member of the outbreak response in Beni, where early indications suggest the man's death was not caused by Ebola or violence.

On guard against complacency

Speaking at a media briefing in Geneva, Matshidiso Moeti, MD, the WHO's regional director for Africa, praised the WHO staff on the ground and the leadership of the DRC's health ministry. ""We can clearly see the strategies that have been successful in controlling the outbreak in some of the affected areas, such as Mangina, Beni, Komanda, and Oicha, though we continue to face flareups in some of these areas and outbreaks in others.""

She said the different outbreak locations involve different drivers of transmission, with response actions tailored accordingly. For example, she said a combination of interventions in Beni and Mangina, including investments in community engagement, have almost brought the Ebola situation almost under control.

""We have been very pleased with the support of local leaders,"" she said. ""Clearly, we can't become complacent. We understand very well that we still have a lot to do to stabilize and bring the situation under control.""

Worry over nosocomial spread

A big ongoing concern is healthcare-related Ebola infections linked to visits at private and public health clinics, Moeti said.

The WHO addressed that issue yesterday in its weekly snapshot of the outbreak, noting that the latest outbreaks in Katwa and Butembo are partly driven by nosocomial infections. Since Dec 1, 86% of patients infected in the two areas (125 of 145) had visited or worked at a healthcare facility before or after they got sick. And, of those, 21% reported having been at a health facility before their Ebola symptoms began, suggesting nosocomial transmission.

Over the past 3 weeks in Katwa, confirmed Ebola patients had been treated in 49 different health settings, including 9 where nosocomial transmission may have occurred. Over the same period, 8 new Ebola infections were reported in Katwa's healthcare workers, pushing the overall outbreak total in medical staff to 65.

""Response teams are following up with the identified healthcare facilities to address gaps around triage, case detection and infection prevention and control measures,"" the WHO said in the update.

Some signs of calming

Mike Ryan, MD, WHO's assistant director-general for emergency preparedness and response, just returned to Geneva from the North Kivu province outbreak area. He told reporters that the area seems to be entering a period of relative calm, following unrest owing to the recent election and other social issues and from general mistrust about Ebola and the outbreak response.

He said health officials are seeing some success in having people from local communities lead the response, and though workers are seeing much lower levels of the reactive type of resistance, security is still a big issue. Responders, he said, still need security escorts and special protocols to stay safe in many areas.

Ryan emphasized that teams are working in all active Ebola transmission zones and that, despite surge staffing because of recent disease spikes in Butembo and Katwa and security challenges, health officials have been able to sustain and increase the number of responders in other area.

Though there are still concerns about pockets of disease in remote locations, a large number of areas haven't seen any new cases in 21 or 42 days and that the geographic scope of the disease is less than before, Ryan said.

The immediate challenge in Butembo and Katwa is containing the virus before it moves again. ""We're working against the clock,"" he said, noting that the disease can move from a rural area back to an urban area. ""It's really important that we chase the tail of this thing and we don't leave any chain of transmission untouched. And that's why we're operating very much deep in the field with our colleagues to chase the virus.""

Experimental treatment update

At today's briefing Moeti said about 350 people with Ebola have been treated with experimental drugs.

Ryan added that, anecdotally, when looking at the results, doctors are seeing higher rates of survival. ""But we have to be extremely careful. There are lots of biases in there regarding the condition of the patient when they arrive—there are so many other factors at play,"" he said. ""But we're certainly encouraged by the data we've seen.""

Randomized controlled trials are under way to more definitively interpret the clinical experience with patients, Ryan said, adding that officials are also seeing that patients who come early for treatment are surviving in much higher numbers. ""We're really trying to work with communities to encourage suspect cases and families to bring their loved ones as soon as possible to the treatment units.""

Latest case details

In its daily update today the DRC's health ministry reported four new cases: two from Butembo, one from Katwa and one from Biena. The illnesses boost the overall outbreak total to 763, which includes 709 confirmed and 54 probable infections. Investigators are still following up on 168 suspected cases.

Also, three more people died from Ebola, one in community in Butembo and two in the city's Ebola treatment center. The deaths put the outbreak's overall fatality count at 471.

In other outbreak developments, the ministry said a new surveillance strategy has been put in place at entry points. The surveillance operates 24 hours a day with police support.

Health officials have identified seven priority locations, and the strategy is already in place at four of them. The outbreak area has 77 entry points where screening is underway, and so far authorities have screened 30 million travelers.

Response worker's death likely not Ebola

Moeti said the Ebola responder who died in Beni was a financial administrator who had been deployed from the Central African Republic. He apparently died in his sleep, a tragedy for the local team and the man's family, she added.

Medical authorities are working to establish the cause of death, but so far, the early indications don't point to Ebola or violence.

In a statement on the man's death today, the WHO's African regional office said, ""Our hearts go out to the family of our colleague. We pay tribute to the many dedicated men and women from across the African region and beyond for their work towards ending the Ebola outbreak in the DRC.""

Feb 1 DRC update

Feb 1 WHO media briefing audio file

Feb 1 WHO African regional office statement",no result found,no result found,no result found,"Six months after the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo began, efforts to stop spread of the disease are producing signs of progress, a senior World Health Organization official told STAT on Thursday.

Transmission has either been halted or significantly reduced in a number of the areas where the disease has spread, said Dr. Mike Ryan, assistant director of the WHO’s emergency preparedness and response program.

But there is still intense transmission in a large city, Katwa, and stopping the disease there is not going to be an easy task, said Ryan. He described the outbreak as more of a series of linked epidemics than one large outbreak.

“The real challenge now is containing the disease and suppressing it there before it does what it’s done before and bounced to somewhere else,” said Ryan, who recently returned to WHO headquarters in Geneva from the latest of several stints in the outbreak zone.

“We have the teams. We have the resources. We now have the entry point with the community. We have the political leadership. … All of the ingredients to make progress are there,” he said. “But it’s making progress quickly enough before the disease bounces and goes somewhere else. And that’s my concern.”

The outbreak, which was declared on Aug. 1, is the second largest ever. As of Thursday, 759 cases have been recorded, and 468 of those people have died.

So far, 18 health zones in two provinces in northeastern Congo — North Kivu and Ituri — have reported cases. That part of the country is engulfed in a decades-long conflict that has significantly hampered efforts to stop spread of the virus.

While moving about can be difficult — unsafe — for the outbreak response workers, people in the area, which is populous, are highly mobile. That has allowed for a frustrating phenomenon in which someone who gets infected in one area will travel to another to evade detection or to be with family, igniting transmission in a new location. On more than one occasion, a place where Ebola transmission had been stopped has experienced renewed spread sparked by the arrival of another infected person.

Earlier this week, the Congolese ministry of health reported on the case of a traveling trader who contracted the disease in Katwa and then returned to his home in Watsa, more than 300 miles — and more than nine hours by road — away. Ryan said a response team quickly moved in and vaccinated the man’s contacts and their contacts to try to prevent the virus from taking off once again.

For much of the autumn the major transmission hot spot was a city of more than 200,000 people called Beni. But after months of effort — and the administration of more than 20,000 doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine made by Merck — the outbreak there appears to be on the verge of ending, Ryan said.

The city had gone nearly three weeks without a case, but recently six new infections there have been reported. All were connected to known chains of transmission, said Ryan, who described the outbreak in Beni as being on “that bouncy road to zero.”

Katwa — and the neighboring city of Butembo — have been harder nuts to crack, with members of the community refusing in many cases to cooperate with the response teams. But Ryan said efforts to get community leaders and civil society groups engaged in the containment fight are bearing fruit.

The number of alerts — tips from people that someone might have Ebola — is on the rise. And people sick with the virus are going to treatments centers earlier in their illness. Where a few weeks ago most people waited eight or 10 days to go, many are now showing up two or three days after developing symptoms. That’s critical: Cases cared for in treatment centers are more likely to survive. It also lowers the risk they’ll transmit the virus to family members.

“Even in Katwa, where there is intense transmission, there are hopeful signs,” said Ryan.

Still, as the grueling outbreak enters month seven, response leaders aren’t taking anything for granted. “A tremendous amount has been achieved. But we’re not done. And we’re nowhere close to being done,” Ryan said. “And we’re going to be working in Katwa for weeks to come to suppress transmission.”"

In other developments, a group of experts today urged the World Health Organization's (WHO's) emergency committee to meet again to consider declaring a public health emergency, and clinical experts pushed for more use of renal replacement therapy to prevent kidney failure in critically ill Ebola patients.

Latest case details

Of the 22 new cases, the health ministry announced 11 of them in its update today. Among those lab-confirmed cases, 10 are in Katwa, with the following areas also reporting cases: Kyondo (4), Butembo (2), Kalunguta (2), Mabalako (1), Mangurujipa (1), Mutwanga (1), and Vuhovi (1). The increase lifts the outbreak's overall total to 785 cases, 731 of them confirmed and 54 listed as probable.

Health officials are still investigating 165 suspected Ebola infections.

In its latest updates the health ministry said 13 more people have died from their infections, 7 in community settings and 6 in Ebola treatment centers. Locations for community deaths, a factor that increases the risk of virus transmission, include Mangurujipa, Mutwanga, Mabalako, Kyondo, Katwa, and Vuhovi.

In a promising development, the ministry said contacts identified in Komanda have completed their 21-day follow-up period. And the number of people immunized with the experimental VSV-EBOV vaccine has risen to 73,309, roughly half of them in Beni and Katwa.

Experts call for global alert

Writing in a Lancet commentary today, several global health experts called for the WHO to reconvene its Ebola emergency committee and consider declaring a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) to address the threat of cross-border spread and to trigger more high-level support for the response. Several of the international experts are from Georgetown University's O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law and Johns Hopkins' Center for Health Security.

The emergency committee last met in October 2018, and its members said they didn't consider the event at that time to be a PHEIC. WHO emergency committees typically meet every 3 months or sooner, if needed.

The authors of the commentary said cases have more than tripled since then, with illnesses detected in 18 health zones and less than 20% of cases coming from known contact lists. They also said a widening outbreak could destabilize the region, especially in South Sudan, where tenuous peace is haunted by continued violence and predicted famine.

Declaring a PHEIC could specify proactive measures that are needed to shore up the response and send a clear signal that UN leadership and high-level political, financial, and technical support are urgently needed.

The expert commenters acknowledged that a PHEIC might escalate conflict by raising the international response's profile. ""Like any complex multilateral negotiation, cultural competence and smart diplomacy are required. Outsiders are unlikely to be privy to all on-the-ground realities and risks,"" the team wrote, adding that problems—if they happen—would require urgent reform of the process.

""WHO has shown leadership and operational endurance, working tirelessly to combat the DRC Ebola epidemic. But WHO and partners cannot succeed alone,"" they wrote, noting that the WHO and United Nations will likely increasingly be called on to response to complex humanitarian crises.

Supportive care, reporting delays

In other medical literature developments:

Experts from Canada and Africa writing in The Lancet today pushed for higher standards for supportive care for patients in Africa's outbreaks. Pointing out the role of renal failure in critically ill patients whose conditions deteriorate, they said that, although conventional dialysis isn't always feasible in many field settings, renal replacement therapy is an option when sterile water is scarce. They wrote that the bags are sealed until use, the approach is feasible, and the treatment would give patients time to recover from Ebola and associated acute renal failure.





Georgia State University scientists who analyzed reporting dates in the DRC's current outbreak in the journal Epidemics yesterday described a two-wave pattern early in the outbreak, with the one surge in the first half of August and the other in late September, likely linked to local armed conflict. They said reporting delays have shown an 81.1% decline and that the epidemic appears to have reached a steady state, averaging about 35 cases a week during the 8 weeks preceding Jan 15.

Two more MERS infections reported in Saudi Arabia

Today Saudi Arabia's ministry of health (MOH) recorded two more MERS-CoV cases, both of which appear to be part of an ongoing outbreak in Wadi ad-Dawasir.

The patients are men ages 42 and 41. The 42-year-old is listed as a secondary household contact, and the 41-year-old is a secondary healthcare contact. Both men are hospitalized for their MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infections.

Over the weekend, the MOH reported at least 5 cases of MERS in Wadi ad-Dawasir, and the country has seen 24 cases since the first of the year. The cases suggest a healthcare-associated outbreak. Along with camel transmission, healthcare-associated outbreaks are a hallmark of MERS-CoV.

Yesterday, Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease blog, reported that agriculture officials in Oman have tested local camels for MERS-CoV, and the animals are negative for the virus. The testing was prompted by 5 recent cases of MERS in Oman, including 2 deaths. Oman has now reported 19 MERS-CoV infections since 2013.

Five cases reported in Texas measles cluster; Washington outbreak grows by 8

Texas health officials are reporting five confirmed measles cases in three neighboring counties in the region around Houston, according to official statements and media reports.

Three of the cases are from Harris County, according to a statement yesterday from Harris County Public Health (HCPH). The patients are two boys who are younger than 2 years old and a woman between ages 25 and 35. All live in the northwestern part of Harris County.

Umair Shah, MD, MPH, executive director at HCPH, said measles is highly contagious and spreads to others through coughing and sneezing. ""However, it is easily preventable. Parents and caregivers have the power to protect their children and themselves from this disease by getting vaccinated,"" he said.

Also, the Galveston County Health District (GCHD) yesterday reported one case involving a boy ages 12 to 24 months who was tested Jan 28 and is part of a measles cluster in the region. And the Associated Press (AP) reported today that Montgomery County, on Harris County's northern border, has confirmed one case and that a possible sixth case in Texas has been identified with testing underway.

Bat Zika virus study finds possible animal model and ecological role

Jamaican fruit bats—one of the most common bat species in the Caribbean region, Central America, and Mexico—may be a useful animal model for studying Zika virus and may play a role in virus ecology, according to experiments conducted by researchers from Colorado State University.

Their two-part study was designed to gauge the susceptibility of the bats to Zika infection and to follow the disease course with tests to assess viremia, tissue tropism, replication, and shedding. The team reported their findings yesterday in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. They noted that experiments in the 1950s and 1960s showed that several bat species were naturally and experimentally susceptible to Zika virus, with some developing neurological disease.

In the new experiments, Jamaican fruit bats infected in the lab mounted an antibody response. In some of the bats during 28-day follow up, researchers found evidence of viral replication and pathologic findings in the brain, testes, lungs, and salivary glands. They didn't find any blood brain barrier disruption and raised the possibility that microglial cells might be the Zika virus entry route to bat brains.

They concluded that bats might be a suitable animal model for studying Zika pathogenesis, including the assessment of sexual transmission, in-utero transmission, birth defects, and neurologic derangements. They also note that Zika could be a wildlife disease that affects bat populations, and more study is needed to fully understand the role bats might play in maintaining the virus.

And in other developments, two more infections were reported in healthcare workers, according to a weekly situation report yesterday from the World Health Organization (WHO).

Ministry details latest case, deaths

Today the DRC's ministry of health confirmed one new case in Katwa, and two new deaths in Katwa and Butembo. The Katwa fatality was a community death. With these new cases, the outbreak totals stand at 789 cases, including 488 deaths.

A total of 199 suspected cases are still under investigation.

Of the two new deaths, the one in Katwa occurred in the community, a factor known to increase the risk of virus spread, and one occurred at Butembo's Ebola treatment center.

Mounting health worker infections

In its situation report yesterday the WHO said two more healthcare workers had been infected with the deadly virus, bringing the total number of healthcare workers infected since August to 65.

Sick health workers are known to amplify Ebola outbreaks, and infection prevention and control gaps in community private and public health centers, where the disease can spread easily when workers and patients aren't adequately protected, have been an ongoing challenge in the DRC's latest outbreak.

With 42 additional Ebola cases reported between Jan 30 and Feb 2, the outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces remains unruly, with new and hold spots recently reporting cases. Twelve health districts reported cases during this time period, the WHO said, with Katwa as the most pressing hotspot for Ebola activity.

""Katwa, Butembo, and Beni remain notable hotspots for the outbreak, with 97/123 (79%) of cases reported in the last three weeks originating from these areas. Trends in case incidence reflect an increase in the number of cases since the start of this year and continuation of the outbreak across a geographically widely dispersed area,"" the WHO said. ""Mabalako, Kalunguta, and Vuhovi are back in the list of health zones that have reported newly confirmed cases in the past 21 days.""

The WHO said the case-fatality rate among confirmed cases is 59%.

Contact tracing, vaccination continue

Contact tracing continues across the region, with 47,600 contacts registered to date and 7,292 currently under surveillance. The WHO said 82% to 88% of those contacts have been followed within the last week.

""WHO continues to monitor alerts from outbreak-affected areas. In the last week, an average of 460 alerts were received per day, of which an average of 497 (91%) were investigated,"" the WHO said. ""Field teams are reviewing and reinforcing active case finding across all areas to ensure new cases are detected as quickly as possible.""

As the outbreak goes into its seventh month, bordering countries are continuing to vaccinate frontline workers. In Uganda, 2,600 workers have been vaccinated, and South Sudan began a vaccination campaign on Jan 28. The WHO said the vaccination of 1,415 frontline workers in Rwanda is imminent.

The DRC said as of today 74,732 people have been vaccinated, including 20,473 in Beni, 18,522 in Katwa, 8,168 in Butembo, 6,035 in Mabalako, 2,736 in Kalunguta, 2,200 in Komanda, 2,074 in Goma, and 1,821 in Oicha.

Philadelphia patient unlikely to have Ebola

Finally today, the Associated Press reported that a patient at a Philadelphia hospital is being tested for Ebola, but likely doesn't have the disease. Officials say the testing is being done because the patient met screening criteria for Ebola, but it is unknown if he or she had traveled to the DRC or had contact with a patient.

7-Feb-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

Despite slightly fewer cases reported during the past week (Figure 1), current epidemiological indicators highlight that the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity. Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while simultaneously, small clusters continue to occur in various geographically dispersed regions. During the last 21 days (23 January – 12 February 2019), 97 new cases have been reported from 13 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (59), Butembo (12), Beni (7), Kyondo (4), Oicha (4), Vuhovi (3), Biena (2), Kalunguta (2), Komanda (1), Manguredjipa (1), Mabalako (1), Masereka (1), and Mutwanga (1).1 The recent case reported in the Komanda health zone was a resident of Katwa who was exposed to the virus, and subsequently travelled to both Bunia and Komanda. This case comes one month after the last reported case in Ituri Province; underscoring the high risks of reintroduction to previously affected areas, as well as the potential for spread to new ones.

As of 12 February, 823 EVD cases2 (762 confirmed and 61 probable) have been reported, including 517 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 63%). Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 118 of 287 health areas across 18 health zones, of which 37 health areas have reported a case in the last 21 days. Thus far, 283 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs) and enrolled in a dedicated monitoring and support programme. One new health worker infection was reported in Katwa. To date, a total of 68 health workers have been infected.

Main challenges this past week primarily pertain to community mistrust, particularly in Katwa, and the difficulty in encouraging community members to be more proactive in reporting suspected cases, presenting early to ETCs for treatment, and participating in community-based prevention and response efforts. However, in the face of these protracted challenges, response strategies have demonstrated to be effective in curtailing the spread of EVD. Fostering greater community trust by strengthening engagement with its members remains a top priority for response teams.

On 13 February, the Ministry of Health (MoH) launched the Strategic Response Plan 3 (SRP 3). The plan lays out the response strategy, objectives and budget requirements for the MoH, WHO, and all implementing partners for the next six months (February through July 2019). SRP 3 takes into account recommendations from operational reviews, and builds on a series of new strategic directions that capitalize on lessons learned under the scope of SRP 2. Activities laid out aim to stop the transmission of EVD in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, and prevent its spread to other provinces and neighbouring countries.

WHO remains confident that this outbreak can be successfully brought to an end through strategies outlined in SRP 3. To achieve the goals set out by the plan, MoH, WHO, and partners are appealing for US$ 148 million. WHO and partners count on the continued support of the international community to provide the required funding in order to stop this outbreak.

Public health response

For further information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last review conducted on 7 February 2019, outlines the high risk the EVD outbreak poses at the national and regional levels, though global risk levels remain low. This EVD outbreak is affecting primarily the north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons, as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the fragile security situation in North Kivu and Ituri, further limits the implementation of response activities.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) health ministry today reported two more Ebola cases, one from Butembo and the other from Kyondo. In addition, 189 suspected cases are under investigation.

Also, officials said four more people died from their infections. They include one from Butembo and one from Kyondo who died in the community, an occurrence known to increase the risk of virus spread. The two others died in Katwa's Ebola treatment center.

Today's developments lift the outbreak total to 791 cases, including 737 confirmed and 54 probable. The fatality count has reached 492.

In its daily update, the health ministry addressed messages circulating on social media that allege that women have been victims of sexual advances in exchange for work on the Ebola response. It notes that though local women's groups have denounced some of the messages as rumors designed to tarnish the image of women working on the outbreak response, the health ministry is taking the allegations seriously. It asked people who have been victims or witnesses of such incidents to report them confidentially.

The ministry emphasized that all outbreak services are free and that anyone offering services for payment in kind or cash should be reported. It also urged women to take safety steps when responding to outbreak response recruitment and employment.

Four more measles cases confirmed in Washington state outbreak

Four more measles cases have been reported in an outbreak in the Vancouver, Wash., area, including three in Oregon's Multnomah County and one in Washington's Clark County, according to official updates.

The three new case-patients in Oregon all had close contact with Multnomah County's first confirmed case, which was reported on Jan 25. The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) said yesterday that the three people have remained at home and are in regular contact with county health officials. The initial case-patient is part of a larger outbreak in Washington's Clark County.

Meanwhile, Clark County has confirmed one new case, raising its total to 50. In an update yesterday, Clark County Public Health said 11 suspected cases are still under investigation. All but two of the cases involve children younger than 18. Of those with measles, 43 were unvaccinated, 6 had unverified immunization status, and 1 had been vaccinated.

In a related development, demand for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is surging in Clark County, even among people who had avoided vaccination, Kaiser Health News (KHN) reported yesterday. Orders were up nearly 500% in January compared with the same month last year. According to the report, health officials had worried about the potential for a measles outbreak in the region, given that only 76.5% of kindergarteners had received all recommended shots for the 2017-2018 school year.

Report details Europe's 2018 measles surge; Philippines declares outbreak

New data for 2018 released today by the World Health Organization (WHO) European regional office shows the highest number of cases in a decade, but that more children than ever before have been vaccinated.

In a statement today, the WHO said the numbers point to uneven progress within countries, leaving pockets of people unprotected. In 2018, 82,596 people in 47 of the region's 53 countries had measles, and 72 died from the disease. Nearly two-thirds of people infected with measles were hospitalized. The total for 2018 was the highest this decade—three times higher than in 2017 and 15 times the record low reported in 2016.

However, the WHO said the surge followed a year (2017) that marked the highest ever estimated coverage (90%) for the second dose of measles vaccine. Coverage of first-dose vaccination also reached a high of 95% in 2017.

The WHO said achievements at the national level can mask gaps at the subnational level, which aren't often recognized until outbreaks occur. It notes that most countries struggling with suboptimal immunization coverage are middle-income countries and that the office is working with them to implement targeted strategies to improve vaccine coverage.

Feb 7 WHO Europe statement

In other international measles developments, the Philippines Department of Health yesterday declared a measles outbreak in the National Capital Region of Luzon island, with 196 cases reported through the first half of January, compared with 20 reported in the area for the same period in 2018. The region includes Manila and has 16 cities and 1 municipality.

In an update today, the health department expanded the outbreak declaration to other regions, including other parts of Luzon and the Central and Eastern Visayas (Visayan Islands). As of Jan 26, the country had recorded 575 cases, 9 of them fatal. Health Secretary Francisco Duque, MD, said in the statement, ""We are expanding the outbreak from metro Manila to the other regions as cases have increased in the past weeks and to strengthen surveillance of new cases and alert mothers and caregivers to be more vigilant.""

UK task force describes 40 recent acute flaccid paralysis cases

The United Kingdom Acute Flaccid Paralysis Task Force today reported 40 cases between Jan 1, 2018, and Jan 21, 2019, up from 28 reported in December by Public Health England.

Writing in Eurosurveillance, the group said the task force was formed in November after PHE began to receive AFP reports and that today's report spells out their early findings.

Of the 40 cases, 9 involve acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) and 9 patients were positive for enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). Tests excluded poliovirus in all but two cases, and investigations are still underway. Aside from the 9 confirmed AFM cases, 7 more are classified as probable and further testing is pending to classify 19 of the other cases. Half of the patients and most of those with EV-D68 infections are children ages 5 and younger.

Clinically, 22 of the patients had experienced a recent acute respiratory illness. Half had paralysis symptoms in all four limbs. Fifteen patients were admitted to intensive care units, including 12 who needed assisted ventilation. Three of the children still have considerable neurologic problems.

The authors said the UK situation is very similar to the pattern seen in the United States, with the increase in polio-like syndrome cases tracking with EV-D68 circulation.

WHO scales up efforts to fight Lassa fever outbreaks in Africa

Five African nations—Nigeria, Benin, Guinea, Liberia, and Togo—are currently fighting Lassa fever outbreaks, and the World Health Organization (WHO) is scaling up efforts to support the countries in outbreak response.

""While these outbreaks are occurring during the Lassa fever season in countries where the disease is endemic, the speed of escalation is of concern,"" the WHO said in a statement today.

Nigeria is the hardest hit country, with 213 confirmed cases, including 42 deaths, reported since Jan 22. Among the confirmed cases are four healthcare workers.

Last year, Nigeria saw its biggest Lassa fever outbreak in decades. Together Benin, Guinea, Liberia and Togo have reported 12 cases, including 2 deaths.

In addition to providing aid and information to those countries, the WHO is also guiding readiness efforts in six other at-risk countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Sierra Leone.

Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic illness, usually transmitted to humans via the urine or feces of rodents. Person-to-person transmission can also occur in healthcare and community settings.

New polio cases reported from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Niger

In the latest polio developments, Afghanistan and Pakistan have reported new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases, their first of 2019, and Niger has reported one circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) case, according to a weekly update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI).

Pakistan's case was reported from Bajour Agency in the Federally Administered Tribal Area in a patient whose paralysis symptoms began on Jan 18. Also, the country reported six more WPV1 environmental positives from samples collected during the first half of January: two from Lahore district, one from Faisalabad in Punjab province, one each from Quetta and Killa Abdulla districts in Balochistan province, in one from DI Kahn in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Afghanistan's latest case was reported from the Spin Boldak district of Kandahar province in a patient whose symptoms began on Jan 4. The detection of a human case follows the recent identification of WPV1 environmental positives in Kandahar and Helmand provinces.

Elsewhere, Niger's latest cVDPV2 case was reported from Magaria district in Zinder province in a patient whose paralysis symptoms began on Dec 5, 2018. The new case brought Niger's cVDPV2 total for 2018 to 10 in an outbreak genetically linked to circulation in Nigeria's Jigwa state.

Preclinicial results promising for Mayaro virus vaccine

A study in mice of a novel, synthetic DNA vaccine against Mayaro virus—a mosquito borne virus that has the potential to follow in Zika's footsteps—showed that it provided potent protection and immune responses.

Mayaro virus, part of the alphavirus family, was first discovered in 1954 and has been confined to parts of Trinidad and Tobago and neighboring areas of South America, but the detection of a case in Haiti in 2015 and lab evidence suggesting multiple mosquito species can carry the virus have raised concerns that it has the capacity to expand to other parts of the Americas. Symptoms of Mayaro virus infection are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya.

Researchers at The Wistar Institute developed the vaccine, which targets the virus' envelope protein, and reported their animal trial findings yesterday in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Mice received intramuscular injection, followed by electroporation to enhance vaccine uptake and provide a dose-sparing effect.

In the virus challenge part of the study, the vaccine completely protected the animals from death and clinical infection signs. Immunization induced neutralizing antibodies and cellular responses to multiple regions of virus' E protein.

Kar Muthumani, PhD, study coauthor and director of The Wistar Institute's Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, said in press release yesterday that the preclinical findings support the need for further testing.

""DNA vaccines have a remarkable safety record in numerous clinical trials, can be designed and manufactured readily, and can be distributed cost-effectively, making them an important tool for combating emerging infectious diseases like MAYV especially in resource-poor settings, where they often arise,"" he said.

""I believe we have prevented the spread of the epidemic in the big cities"" in the region, he said.

""The teams also managed to contain its the spread of the epidemic to neighbouring countries,"" he added.

""The biggest problem is the high mobility of the population,"" the minister added.

The outbreak started last August in the North Kivu region, which borders Uganda and Rwanda.

The Spanish wing of the aid agency Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, reported on Twitter on Saturday that there had been a surge in cases since January 15.

Rwanda, Uganda and South Sudan in the north were all now on alert, it added.

Ebola is a serious infectious disease that can spread rapidly through small amounts of bodily fluid, causing internal bleeding and potentially death.

The latest outbreak is the tenth in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since Ebola was first detected there in 1976.

The deadly outbreak is the second largest in history, behind the devastating West Africa outbreak that killed thousands a few years ago, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Two of the latest lab-confirmed cases are from Butembo and one is from Vuhovi. The latest developments bring the overall outbreak total to 816 cases, which includes 755 confirmed and 61 probable infections. Outbreak responders are also investigating 178 suspected Ebola cases.

Eleven more people died from their infections. Seven occurred in the community, including six from Katwa and one from Vuhovi. Four people died in Ebola treatment centers, including three from Butembo and one from the Katwa facility. The latest deaths lift the outbreak's fatality total to 513.

In other outbreak developments, the ministry said in its Feb 9 update that immunization of primary care providers has started in Rwampara, a new health zone in Ituri province. It said it took the step, because the health zone is located on a road used by thousands of people from Beni, and that vaccinating health workers is part of plan to limit the spread of the virus to other provinces.

Rotavirus symptoms and costs in household contacts

Rotavirus-related acute gastroenteritis in children poses a significant burden on household contacts, especially children younger than 5 years old, according to a study from researchers with the New Vaccine Surveillance Network, which included scientists with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

To examine transmission and impact of rotavirus on families, the group enrolled children between the ages of 15 days through age 10 who were seen for acute gastroenteritis at emergency departments at seven different medical centers between December 2011 and June 2016. The team published their findings in the Feb 7 issue Journal of the Pediatric infectious Diseases Society.

Their analysis included 829 kids who were positive for rotavirus and 8,858 who tested negative. They found that households of confirmed rotavirus patients were more likely to report acute gastrointestinal illness and one or more household contact than kids who tested negative for the virus, 35% and 20%, respectively.

Overall, 466 (16%) of the household contacts of rotavirus patients reported illness symptoms. Of that group, 107 (23%) sought medical care, of which 6 (6%) resulted in hospitalization. Household contacts who were younger than 5 were more likely to report illness than those in other age groups (odds ratio, 2.2 [P=.004]). Also, 144 households reported out-of-pocket expenses that ranged from $2 to $640 (median, $20).

Researchers note that traditional cost burden studies haven't adequately direct[O1] and indirect costs for the household. ""Prevention of pediatric rotavirus illness, especially though vaccination, can prevent additional illnesses in HHCs [household contacts],"" they wrote.

Study: Flu vaccination cut hospitalization in Israeli children

Flu vaccination helped prevent hospitalization in fully vaccinated children in Israel, according to new findings based on three flu seasons. A team from Clalit Health Services in Israel and the University of Michigan reported their findings today in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

The team compared flu-positive cases and test-negative controls; 326 and 2,821, respectively, from 2015-16, 36 and 1,069 from 2016-17, and 150 and 781 from 2017-18.

Over the three seasons, vaccine effectiveness (VE) for fully vaccinated children was 53.9% children (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.6% to 68.3%), compared with a statistically not significant 25.6% for partially vaccine kids (95% CI, -3% to 47%). The researchers noted that VE varied depending on the makeup of the seasonal strains that circulated.

For example, for the 2015-16 season, most viruses were 2009 H1N1 and there was a mismatched influenza B lineage, and VE for fully vaccinated kids was statistically significant for influenza A, but not influenza B. For the 2016-17 season when H3N2 was predominant, VE was 70.8% (95% CI, 17.4% to 92.4%). And for the following season when H3N2, 2009 H1N1, and a mismatched B lineage circulated, VE was statistically significant for influenza B but not influenza A.

The authors concluded that flu immunization was effective in preventing hospitalization in fully vaccinated Israeli kids, but not among their partially vaccinated peers. Also, the team observed signs of cross-lineage protection in a season when the vaccine contained B/Victoria and the circulating lineage was B/Yamagata, but not in a season in which the opposite occurred.

Prior dengue may prime women for severe Zika in pregnancy

A new animal model study published in Immunity suggests that pregnancies in hosts with a prior dengue infection may be more likely to result in severe outcomes from Zika virus illness.

The study was conducted by researchers at Mount Sinai, who transferred dengue virus-specific antibodies into mice before infecting the mice with Zika during pregnancy. Priming the mice with dengue led to increased placental damage, fetal growth, and fetal resorption.

""Our data demonstrate that antibodies generated from a previous dengue virus infection can enhance the severity of Zika virus infection during pregnancy,"" said Jean Lim, PhD, lead study author and associate professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in a press release. ""Our research may explain the high rate of microcephaly and birth defects observed in the recent Zika virus outbreak in South America.""

Both dengue and Zika are flaviviruses, vector-borne diseases that tend to co-circulate in communities. Dengue is antibody-dependent–enhancing, meaning that prior infections with the virus heighten the response to future infections instead of protect against them.

Three more cases, community deaths

In its daily update, the DRC's ministry of health confirmed 3 more Ebola cases, bringing the outbreak total to 819, of which 758 are confirmed and 61 are probable. In total there have been 516 deaths, and 170 cases are still under investigation.

The new cases came from Katwa, Komanda, and Butembo. Three new community deaths were also recorded in the same cities. Community deaths, or those outside of a hospital or treatment center, raise the risk of Ebola transmission.

One of the community deaths in Komanda was a woman who refused follow-up and vaccination after her husband died from the virus. The woman was originally from Katwa and died among family members in Bunia who attempted to hide her corpse from officials.

Also today, the DRC said it had never received any reports of sexual exploitation among its staff.

The declaration was prompted by a story today in The Guardian that suggested some Congolese women and girls were being sexually exploited by health workers in order to obtain the Ebola vaccine.

""To date, the Ministry of Health has never received any complaints or reports of sexual exploitation by its staff as part of the Ebola response,"" the DRC said.

""Rumors about this had been circulating on social networks at one time and the Ministry of Health had been very clear that there would be no tolerance for this kind of behavior. Additional measures are being put in place to ensure a better system for detecting such incidents in the community.""

Ebola scare in Uganda

A family's transport of a Ugandan man who died on Feb 8 in the DRC's outbreak region across the border and back into Uganda sparked intensive contact tracing, location of the body, and sample testing, according to a statement yesterday from the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office.

The 46-year-old man was a construction worker who had been living and working the DRC for the past 8 years. He was first admitted to the hospital in Bunia, one of the towns in Ituri province that has reported Ebola cases, in November 2018 with symptoms that included chest pain and a sometimes-bloody cough.

Over the past week his condition worsened and he died at Bunia Hospital, where staff issued a death certificate and released his body to relatives, which included a group of 13 people from Tororo in Uganda. The group used the death certificate to cross the border and other checkpoints with the body. According to the statement, the death certificate said the man's cause of death was cardiac failure and pulmonary tuberculosis.

After learning of the incident, Uganda's health ministry—with support from the WHO—intercepted the man's relatives and the vehicle with the dead body in it before they reached their village in Tororo district. A ministry burial team and surveillance officer took oral swabs, conducted a verbal autopsy, and made plans to conduct a safe and dignified burial.

Yonas Tegegn Woldermariam, MD, the WHO's Uganda representative, said in the statement, ""The immediate reporting by UMA and quick action by health workers as exhibited last night in this particular incident is what determines how quickly we respond and contain Ebola. I urge other Ugandans to take this as an excellent example as we prepare for a possible importation of EVD cases.""

Uganda's health ministry said on Twitter that its teams conducted a dignified burial of the man in Tororo and that all people who were in close contact with the body have been quarantined. It added that samples taken from the dead man were sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute, where they tested negative for Ebola. It emphasized that there are no confirmed Ebola cases from Uganda.

As part of preparedness efforts for possible spread of the virus across the border, Uganda has been vaccinating healthcare and front-line workers in high-risk districts since Nov 7. So far 3,587 have been immunized, the health ministry said.

Despite slightly fewer cases reported during the past week (Figure 1), current epidemiological indicators highlight that the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity. Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while simultaneously, small clusters continue to occur in various geographically dispersed regions. During the last 21 days (23 January – 12 February 2019), 97 new cases have been reported from 13 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (59), Butembo (12), Beni (7), Kyondo (4), Oicha (4), Vuhovi (3), Biena (2), Kalunguta (2), Komanda (1), Manguredjipa (1), Mabalako (1), Masereka (1), and Mutwanga (1).1 The recent case reported in the Komanda health zone was a resident of Katwa who was exposed to the virus, and subsequently travelled to both Bunia and Komanda. This case comes one month after the last reported case in Ituri Province; underscoring the high risks of reintroduction to previously affected areas, as well as the potential for spread to new ones.

As of 12 February, 823 EVD cases2 (762 confirmed and 61 probable) have been reported, including 517 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 63%). Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 118 of 287 health areas across 18 health zones, of which 37 health areas have reported a case in the last 21 days. Thus far, 283 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs) and enrolled in a dedicated monitoring and support programme. One new health worker infection was reported in Katwa. To date, a total of 68 health workers have been infected.

Main challenges this past week primarily pertain to community mistrust, particularly in Katwa, and the difficulty in encouraging community members to be more proactive in reporting suspected cases, presenting early to ETCs for treatment, and participating in community-based prevention and response efforts. However, in the face of these protracted challenges, response strategies have demonstrated to be effective in curtailing the spread of EVD. Fostering greater community trust by strengthening engagement with its members remains a top priority for response teams.

On 13 February, the Ministry of Health (MoH) launched the Strategic Response Plan 3 (SRP 3). The plan lays out the response strategy, objectives and budget requirements for the MoH, WHO, and all implementing partners for the next six months (February through July 2019). SRP 3 takes into account recommendations from operational reviews, and builds on a series of new strategic directions that capitalize on lessons learned under the scope of SRP 2. Activities laid out aim to stop the transmission of EVD in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, and prevent its spread to other provinces and neighbouring countries.

WHO remains confident that this outbreak can be successfully brought to an end through strategies outlined in SRP 3. To achieve the goals set out by the plan, MoH, WHO, and partners are appealing for US$ 148 million. WHO and partners count on the continued support of the international community to provide the required funding in order to stop this outbreak.

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last review conducted on 7 February 2019, outlines the high risk the EVD outbreak poses at the national and regional levels, though global risk levels remain low. This EVD outbreak is affecting primarily the north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons, as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the fragile security situation in North Kivu and Ituri, further limits the implementation of response activities.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Bunia, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the 19th health district to confirm an Ebola case, the DRC's ministry of health said today in its daily update.

The case in Bunia is in a 6-month-old baby whose mother died from the virus. The mother was from Katwa, and her corpse was intercepted in Komanda, where the baby is currently being treated in an Ebola treatment center.

The baby is among 6 new cases reported today, which also include 3 in Katwa, and 2 in Butembo. The cases raise the outbreak total to 829, of which 786 cases are confirmed and 61 are probable. A total of 201 cases are still under investigation, which is up from 177 yesterday.

Four new fatalities recorded today raise the death toll in the outbreak to 521. Among the new deaths are 3 community deaths in Katwa and Butembo, the current disease hot spots.

The ministry of health said 79,146 people have been vaccinated against the virus with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, including 20,547 in Beni, 19,971 in Katwa, and 9,214 in Butembo.

Oman reports 4 new MERS infections, Saudi Arabia 1

Several Arabic media outlets are reporting that the Omani ministry of health has confirmed 4 more MERS cases in Oman, while Saudi Arabia also noted a new, fatal case.

The Omani cases are part of an ongoing outbreak and bring the total to 10 recent cases of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in that country, which had not seen the a MERS case since March 2018.

According to Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease tracking blog, the Omani ministry of health said the 10 cases have resulted in 4 deaths in different provinces. If confirmed, that would mean the outbreak is no longer contained to a single family farm, as reported by the World Health Organization on Feb 11.

The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MOH), meanwhile, today recorded another new MERS-CoV case for epidemiologic week 7 in Wadi ad-Dawasir.

The infection lifts the country's MERS-CoV cases since the first of the year to 61, which includes 38 from Wadi ad-Dawasir, the site of a possible hospital-based outbreak.

The patient is a 60-year-old man who died after acquiring MERS in a healthcare setting. He did not have camel contact, a known risk factor, the Saudi MOH said.

Study: 1 to 4 meningitis B outbreaks on US college campuses annually

According to a study yesterday in Emerging Infectious Diseases, from 2013 to 2017 officials confirmed one to four meningococcal serogroup B outbreaks on American college campuses annually, which suggests that wider use of the MenB vaccine could be used in outbreak and non-outbreak settings.

Since 2005, most American college students have been vaccinated with the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine covering serogroups A, C, W, and Y (MenACWY), but serotype B has now become the most prevalent on college campuses. In 2013, MenB became available for outbreak response, and, by 2015, MenB vaccines were available for wider use, though not routinely administered.

From January 2013 to May 2018, there were 10 university-based meningococcal disease outbreaks caused by serogroup B reported in seven states, which resulted in 39 cases and 2 deaths (5% case-fatality rate).

""Only 1 case occurred in a student who previously received MenB vaccine; this student had been vaccinated with 1 dose of MenB vaccine 6 days before disease onset,"" the study authors, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said. ""The remaining cases occurred in persons believed to be unvaccinated with MenB vaccine.""

In all but two outbreaks, mass vaccination campaigns with MenB were put in place across campus, and the vaccine was also offered at campus health centers, by appointment, and during seasonal flu vaccinations. Still, MenB vaccination coverage in response to university-based outbreaks was highly variable, ranging from an estimated 14% to 98% for the first dose (median, 67%), the study authors said.

""Coverage with >1 dose of MenB vaccine among persons 17 years of age was estimated to be 14.5% in 2017 (13), and a recent survey demonstrated that only 2% of universities require MenB vaccination for student,"" the authors concluded. ""Achieving high MenB vaccination coverage is necessary to help protect persons during outbreaks of meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B.""

Meanwhile, in a daily update today, the DRC's health ministry announced that the virus has likely infected six more people, in Katwa and Komanda, and killed five more, including an infant.

Community resistance still a factor

The WHO said Katwa and Butembo are still the hot spots, though small widely dispersed clusters continue to be reported.

It added that a recent illness reported in Komanda in a person from Katwa who had also traveled to Bunia highlights the threat of reintroducing the virus into earlier affected areas where cases had declined.

The WHO said that, over the past week, top challenges have been community mistrust, especially in Katwa, and difficulty encouraging members of the public to be more proactive in reporting people with suspected cases, seeking early care at Ebola treatment centers, and participating in community-based response actions.

Still, proven response steps have curbed the spread of Ebola, the agency said. ""Fostering greater community trust by strengthening engagement with its members remains a top priority for response teams,"" the WHO said.

One more health worker infection was reported, an individual in Katwa, raising that number to 68.

On Feb 13 the DRC's health ministry launched the third phase of its response, which will cover the next 6 months, with the main goals of stopping transmission in North Kivu and Ituri provinces and prevent spread of Ebola to other DRC provinces and neighboring countries.

To support the next phase, the WHO, the DRC, and their partners are asking for $148 million from the international community.

Two confirmed cases, baby's death

In addition to two new confirmed cases today, the DRC health ministry reported four new probable cases, all in Komanda. The developments lift the overall outbreak total to 835 cases, which includes 770 confirmed and 65 probable cases. An additional 221 suspected cases are still under investigation.

In addition, officials said five more people died from their infections, one in a community setting in Katwa and four in treatment centers—three in Katwa and one in Bunia.

Included in the total is a 6-month old baby from Bunia whose illness was announced yesterday and who died at the city's Ebola treatment center after being in critical condition, which prohibited transfer to the Ebola facility in Komanda.

The mother was from Katwa and died from the disease, and authorities intercepted her body in Komanda. The latest deaths bring the outbreak's fatality count to 530.

In other outbreak developments, the total number of people vaccinated is approaching 80,000. In its update today, the health ministry said that, since Aug 8, 2018, a total of 79,774 people have been immunized with Merck's unlicensed VSV-EBOV vaccine.

On Saturday and Sunday, the DRC's health ministry said there were two new Ebola cases in Katwa, and one new case in Vuhovi. Today, the ministry reported two new cases, one each in Katwa and Butembo.

The new cases raise the outbreak total to 840 cases, of which 775 are confirmed and 65 are probable. There have been 537 deaths during the outbreak, and 185 suspected cases are still under investigation.

Seven deaths were recorded over the last 3 days, including three community deaths in Katwa, Butembo, and Vuhovi. Community deaths, which occur outside of a hospital or Ebola treatment center, raise the risk of Ebola transmission.

Vaccinations pass the 80,000 mark

Since August, a total of 80,989 people in the DRC and neighboring countries have been vaccinated with Merck's candidate VSV-EBOV vaccine, including 20,593 in Katwa.

On Friday, Martin Fayulu, the leader of the Lamuka party, visited Butembo and called for the observance of hygiene measures at a rally.

Fayulu contests the results of the late-December presidential election which saw him narrowly losing to Felix Tshisekedi, and considers himself president-elect of the DRC. Fayulu also visited a treatment center in Katwa and praised local health workers for their job.

The visit took place against the backdrop against growing violence in the region, which prompted Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to withdraw nonessential aid workers from Masisi, in North Kivu province.

According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), MSF suspended work in the region after gunmen abducted two staff members on Feb 8. Though the region is not currently the site of any Ebola activity, the area is only 100 kilometers from Goma, the capital of North Kivu.

Beni news comes with caution about reintroduction risk

In its statement today, the health ministry called the situation in Beni a ""major breakthrough,"" following a peak in cases that occurred there between September and November.

As Ebola raged in Beni during those months, the city was not only the setting for clashes with armed rebel groups, resulting in community protests that temporarily brought the Ebola outbreak response to a halt. As with some other locations, responders in Beni have also grappled with community resistance to actions such as case finding, contact tracing, and vaccination.

The achievement means Ebola activity in Beni is currently under control, and it added that five other health zones have also gone more than 21 days without reporting any new confirmed Ebola cases. They are Kayina, Mandima, Musienene, Nyankunde, and Tchomia.

However, Beni is still at risk of Ebola reintroduction, given frequent travel between Beni and the current hotspots of Katwa and Butembo, which over the past 21 days have reported 92 confirmed cases, the ministry said.

Latest cases push total to 844

Of the four new cases the health ministry reported today, three are from Katwa and one is from Butembo. Katwa is located on the eastern outskirts of Butembo. The cases boost the outbreak total to 844 cases, 779 of them confirmed and 65 listed as probable.

Also, health officials are still investigating 196 suspected cases.

Two more people died from their Ebola infections, both of them individuals from Katwa who died in the community, a factor known to increase the risk of transmission, since the virus can spread easily when patients are at their sickest and when their caregivers aren't protected.

""Noting that these experimental vaccines are non-replicating or replication deficient, pregnant and lactating women should be included into the clinical trial protocol.The protocol must include provisions for safety monitoring and for documentation of EVD cases among vaccinees, including follow-up of pregnant women and their offspring,"" SAGE said today in its interim recommendations on vaccinations against Ebola.

Currently Merck's unlicensed rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine has been used on 81,702 people in the DRC and surrounding countries in a ring vaccination campaign targeting case contacts and healthcare workers, the DRC said in an update today.

According to SAGE, as of Feb 13, 57% of the confirmed and probable cases are females of which 61% (35% of total cases) are of childbearing age (15 to 49 years).

Pregnant and lactating women have been excluded from receiving the vaccine because it contains a live virus, but experts and working groups have publicly argued that including pregnant women in the vaccination program will help stop the spread of the deadly disease.

""The DRC's decision to extend Ebola vaccine coverage to pregnant women is a huge step forward, not only for pregnant women in areas affected by outbreaks but for all pregnant women who may face the threat of Ebola in the future,"" Carleigh Krubiner, PhD, a fellow at the Center for Global Development and a member of a working group that argued for the inclusion of pregnant women in the ring vaccine campaign, said in a statement emailed to journalists.

Krubiner added that including pregnant and lactating women ""will also provide a critical opportunity to advance the evidence base on the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine so that decisionmakers in the future will be able to make informed decisions about how best to protect their populations, including pregnant women, in the event of an outbreak.""

Three new cases, 1 new death

The DRC health ministry, in its daily update today, confirmed three new Ebola cases, two in Katwa and one in Butembo. Both cities are current hot spots for Ebola activity.

Feb 20 DRC update

Dec 6, 2018, CIDRAP News story ""Guidance seeks to increase outbreak vaccines in pregnant women""",no result found,no result found,no result found,"Women who are pregnant and lactating, as well as children under the age of 1, will be offered access to an experimental Ebola vaccine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, officials said Wednesday, marking the reversal of a controversial policy that had drawn fire from public health experts.

The decision was made by a committee advising the Congolese Ministry of Health, but received the support of the World Health Organization. It followed an outcry over the exclusion of pregnant women from the vaccination program, with some experts calling the initial policy “indefensible.”

Proponents of the earlier policy argued that the vaccine, which goes by the provisional name V920, might harm the fetus or trigger a miscarriage. They noted that there were no data to show the vaccine was safe to use in this very vulnerable population.

But critics countered that unless the vaccine is used in pregnant women there would never be data to determine whether it was safe. And they noted that while there may be some risk involved in vaccinating pregnant and lactating women, the risk to them from Ebola is greater. Some studies have suggested that 90 percent of pregnant women who are infected die, and fetal loss is almost a given.

The decision to exclude lactating women stemmed from concerns the vaccine viruses might be transmitted via breast milk. Children under the age of 1 were excluded from vaccination because the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness in this group hasn’t been tested. (An earlier decision to lower the threshold for those eligible for vaccination from 6 years old to 12 months old was made without the benefit of a clinical trial.)

With supplies of the vaccine limited, health officials in the DRC have been offering it to people who have been in contact with an Ebola patient — people who have a real risk of contracting the disease. Contacts of the contacts are also eligible. The goal is to protect everyone in the virus’ path, eventually blocking its opportunity to continue to spread.

As of Tuesday nearly 82,000 people in North Kivu and Ituri — the provinces where the outbreak is occurring — have been vaccinated. The vaccine, which has yet to be licensed, is being developed by Merck.

Carleigh Krubiner, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, welcomed the news.

“The DRC’s decision to extend Ebola vaccine coverage to pregnant women is a huge step forward, not only for pregnant women in areas affected by outbreaks but for all pregnant women who may face the threat of Ebola in the future,” Krubiner said in a statement.

To date there have been 848 confirmed and probable cases in this outbreak, which is now in its seventh month. Of those, 529 people have died. The WHO estimates that 57 percent of those cases are women; 35 percent of the total cases have been women of childbearing age.

Children, too, have made up a startling share of the cases in this outbreak. Just under a third of cases have been children under the age of 18, and half of those have been in kids under the age of 5, the U.N. International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) reported in its most recent update.

Krubiner said the policy reversal will not only offer pregnant women the protection of the vaccine, but also provide a critical chance to see how the vaccine works in these women. That knowledge will be of benefit in future outbreaks, she said.

The experts who advise the WHO on vaccine policy — the strategic advisory group of experts on immunization, known as the SAGE — stressed that if the vaccine is to be used in these new groups efforts must be made to collect data that can inform future policy on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine for babies and pregnant and lactating women.

The decision was also applauded by Doctors Without Borders, which had opposed the exclusion of pregnant women.

Dr. Séverine Caluwaerts, a Belgian gynecologist who volunteers with MSF —the acronym is based on the organization’s name in French — said in reality some pregnant women have already received the vaccine, because they were vaccinated before they knew they were pregnant. MSF has heard reports of at least 20 such cases in this outbreak, Caluwaerts said.

She argued there’s a bigger picture that needs to be considered. When Ebola kills women of childbearing ages, it also endangers the lives of young children they leave behind.

“The most important factor for child survival in Africa is an alive mother,” said Caluwaerts. “There are data [that suggest] if your mother dies at birth your chance of becoming 5 years old are, like 10 percent, because your mum needs to be there to take care of you.”

Already this outbreak has created a large number of orphans. The most recent UNICEF report, dated Feb. 3, said that 908 children have either been orphaned or separated from parents as a result of the outbreak so far.

Reluctance to offer the vaccine to pregnant and lactating women is based on the fact it is a live-virus vaccine. The virus it contains is not Ebola; it is a livestock virus called vesicular stomatitis virus that can infect, but does not sicken people. A key protein from the Ebola virus has been fused to the VSV virus, which then prompts the immune system to develop a protective response to Ebola.

Traditionally there has been concern about using live-virus vaccines in pregnant women. Krubiner and others have argued that women ought to be informed of the risks and offered the choice.

Dr. Jon Abramson, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Wake Forest School of Medicine, notes there is a precedent here. Several years ago the SAGE — which he chaired from 2013 to 2016 — agreed that during dangerous yellow fever outbreaks pregnant women should be offered the chance to be vaccinated. The yellow fever vaccine is also a live-virus vaccine and it is known to cause serious side effects in a small portion of people who receive it.

Abramson said the circumstances of this outbreak warrant consideration of dropping the vaccine exclusions.

“I think it is reasonable, given the particular epidemiology and the number of children dying, to think about using it,” he told STAT. “Because at least we know that the vaccine works in other age groups.”

“But if we’re going to do that, we need to also get the data to tell us how effective it is in pregnant women and children,” he insisted.

It was not immediately clear whether all children — even newborns — could be vaccinated. Nor is it clear how the WHO feels about this part of the decision. The statement from the SAGE committee said it “welcomes and supports’’ the DRC’s decision to offer the Ebola vaccine to pregnant women and “acknowledges” the decision to offer it to children under 1.

The WHO did not immediately respond to a request for an interview.

A spokeswoman for the Congolese Ministry of Health, Jessica Illunga, said it would not make any statement on the policy change until a final pending authorization had been approved later this week.

In another Ebola vaccine development, the report from the SAGE committee revealed that the group has recommended the testing of other experimental Ebola vaccines during this outbreak.

Three in particular were considered: one made by Johnson and Johnson and a Russian and a Chinese vaccine. The latter two have been licensed in those countries, but none of the three has been proven to be protective in a Phase 3 clinical trial.

The committee recommended that these vaccines could be used in clinical trials that enroll health care and front line workers in areas around the outbreak zone — areas where Ebola is not transmitting but might at some point.

Pregnant and lactating women could also be enrolled in these trials, the committee said, because the formulations of the other vaccines are different and do not raise the same safety concerns.

Talks about using other vaccines in DRC or potentially neighboring countries during this outbreak have been ongoing for months. It is not clear how quickly the other vaccines might actually be deployed."
21-Feb-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity. Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while simultaneously, small clusters continue to occur in various geographically dispersed locations. During the last 21 days (30 January – 19 February 2019), 79 new cases have been reported from 40 health areas within 12 health zones (Figure 1), including: Katwa (46), Butembo (15), Kyondo (4), Vuhovi (4), Kalunguta (2), Oicha (2), Biena (1), Mabalako (1), Manguredjipa (1), Masereka (1), Mutwanga (1), and Rwampara (1).1

No new cases have been reported from the Beni in the last three weeks. This is a significant achievement given the previous intensity of the outbreak in this area. Elsewhere, trends in the case incidence (Figure 2) have been encouraging; however, other indicators (such as the continued high proportion of community deaths, persistent delays in case detection, documented local travel amongst many cases, and relatively low numbers of cases among contacts under surveillance) suggest a high risk of further chains of transmission in affected communities. Response teams must maintain a high degree of vigilance across all areas with declining case and contact tracing activity, as with areas with active cases, to rapidly detect new cases and prevent onward transmission.

As of 19 February, 848 EVD cases2 (783 confirmed and 65 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (485) were female and 30% (258) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 119 of 301 health areas across 19 health zones. Ongoing cleaning of case databases this past week corrected to the number of deaths and survivors discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) thus far; overall 529 deaths (case fatality ratio: 62%) and 257 survivors have been reported to date.

To complement ongoing response activities, the Ministry of Health is establishing a Strategic Coordination Centre in Goma. The new Centre will support the coordination and monitoring of the operations in close collaboration with sub-coordination teams working across all affected areas. The implementation of the Strategic Coordination Centre in Goma will not impact on the response capacity in the field, with WHO and partners continuing to maintain full-scale operations in Beni, Butembo and Bunia, as well as a strong presence in all affected Health Zones, to ensure the effectiveness of field operations.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. National and regional risk levels remain very high, though global risk levels remain low. This EVD outbreak is affecting primarily the north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons, as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria, measles), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the fragile security situation in North Kivu and Ituri, further limits the implementation of response activities.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

There are now 853 cases (788 confirmed and 65 probable), including 531 deaths, and 177 cases are still under investigation. The new confirmed cases include three in Katwa and one each in Kyondo and Kalunguta.

Also reported today were two community deaths in confirmed cases in Katwa. Community deaths raise the risk of transmission.

The ministry of health also detailed the temporary halting of surveillance activities in Vuhovi, after a nurse from the Bisongo health center was abducted and murdered. Officials said a group of unidentified people carried out the attack.

""Contrary to certain information that has circulated, the patients of the Vuhovi General Reference Hospital have not been hunted, and they continue to be cared for on site,"" the health ministry said, adding that it is encouraging health workers to resume outbreak activities.

New vaccination campaign

Today front-line workers in the Lolwa health zone, which lies between Komanda and Rwampara on the road connecting Beni to Bunia, were vaccinated in a preventive effort, the ministry said.

Since August, 82,144 people in the DRC and surrounding countries have been vaccinated with Merck’s rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. About half of those vaccinations have taken place in Katwa and Beni.

Today the World Health Organization (WHO) published an outbreak update and noted that Katwa and Butembo remain the areas of concern.

No new cases have been recorded in Beni for more than 3 weeks, but, from Jan 30 to Feb 19, 40 health areas in 12 health zones recorded 79 cases: Katwa (46), Butembo (15), Kyondo (4), Vuhovi (4), Kalunguta (2), Oicha (2), Biena (1), Mabalako (1), Manguredjipa (1), Masereka (1), Mutwanga (1), and Rwampara (1).

""Trends in the case incidence have been encouraging; however, other indicators (such as the continued high proportion of community deaths, persistent delays in case detection, documented local travel amongst many cases, and relatively low numbers of cases among contacts under surveillance) suggest a high risk of further chains of transmission in affected communities,"" the WHO said.

""Response teams must maintain a high degree of vigilance across all areas with declining case and contact tracing activity, as with areas with active cases, to rapidly detect new cases and prevent onward transmission.""

The WHO said the case-fatality rate for the outbreak is 62%.

Survival trend for favipiravir recipients

In research news, today the Journal of Infectious Diseases published a retrospective study on survival rates of Ebola patients who received favipiravir in Guinea during the West African Ebola outbreak in 2015.

Favipiravir, also known as T-705 or Avigan, is an experimental antiviral drug manufactured by Toyama Chemical of Japan.

In the study, the case-fatality rate in favipiravir-treated patients was lower than in untreated patients (31/73 [42.5%] vs 52/90 [57.8%], P = 0.053 in univariate analysis), but the authors write that the effect did not reach statistical significance.

Today's announcement also noted five other new cases, including four from two current hot spots.

In other Ebola developments, a research team from the United Kingdom and Guinea that conducted a detailed epidemiological investigation paired with antibody testing in the Guinea community where West Africa's outbreak began found evidence of eight more survivors and two probable deaths from the virus.

Survivor contact suspected

The newly confirmed patient from Beni was apparently exposed to the body fluids of an Ebola survivor, the ministry said in its statement today, adding that a thorough investigation and genetic sequencing is underway to determine the epidemiological links between the cases.

In the waning months of West Africa's Ebola outbreak, sexual transmission linked to survivors was strongly suspected in many recurrence events. Immune-protected areas of the body such as the testes and the eyes can harbor the virus, perhaps for as long as 1 year.

Of the five other new cases today, two are from Katwa, two are from Butembo, and one is from Kalunguta. Authorities are also investigating 179 suspected Ebola cases. Today's six new cases lift the outbreak total to 859 cases, which includes 794 confirmed and 65 probable infections.

The health ministry reported five more deaths, three of which occurred in the community—two in Katwa and one in Butembo. The other two people died in Ebola treatment centers, one in Katwa and one in Butembo. So far, 536 fatalities have been reported in the DRC's outbreak.

In other developments, the health ministry said the Ebola strategic coordination office today began its move from Beni to Goma, the capital of North Kivu province. Health minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, in late November decided to relocate the office to Goma to separate planning and supervision activities from field operations. According to the statement, the move to Goma will make it easier for the ministry's partners to get security clearances to work on the Ebola response. It added that the move won't disrupt daily response activities in Beni, which will still have a subcoordination center as for other main hot spots such as Butembo and Katwa.

""It is important to note that this move to Goma in no way means that the Ebola outbreak has reached the city, although it remains exposed,"" the ministry said, noting that placing the coordinating office in an area not affected by the outbreak allows it to focus on supervision, monitoring, and planning.

More clues from Guinea's first outbreak

In an effort to reconstruct early Ebola transmission in Meliandou, Guinea, the remote heavily forested area where West Africa's outbreak began in December 2013, researchers from the United Kingdom and Guinea conducted detailed interviews with all households in the village and used a validated oral test detect Ebola IgG antibodies. The described their findings yesterday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

The group conducted the study in June and July of 2017, enrolling 237 participants from 27 Meliandou households. All adults who agreed to be interviewed were provided oral fluid for the tests, and 224 samples were suitable for testing.

They found that illnesses were more widespread than the 11 cases originally reported from the area, which includes a 2-year-old boy thought have been the first case and to have been exposed to the virus by a bat.

Researchers identified two more probable deaths and eight previously unrecognized IgG-positive survivors, including one person who had mild illness and another who was asymptomatic, for a case fatality of 55.6% for adults, much lower than originally reported 100%.

When they looked at epidemiological connections among the village's cases, healthcare work and exposure level stood out as independent risk factors.

For example, the 2-year-old boy spread the virus to his sister and mother who was pregnant and had a spontaneous abortion the night she died. Over that period, family members and healthcare workers cared for her, which the researchers said was an amplification event that spread Ebola to other households.

The team said the noninvasive oral test was acceptable to the community and has the potential to reveal more about mild and symptomatic infection and transmission patterns within communities.

'Brilliant' epi sleuthing

In a related commentary in the same journal issue, two experts from Harvard Medical School's Department of Global Health and Social Medicine called the study ""a brilliant piece of epidemiological sleuthing"" that pairs classic field investigation with an oral Ebola antibody test. The authors are Eugene Richardson, MD, PhD, and Mosoka Fallah, PhD, MPH.

They wrote that the study shows almost double the number of people infected with Ebola and that mild infections may have been common in West Africa's outbreak.

Though the study uncovers important insights into the start of the outbreak, they said it's important to keep in mind that a combination of social factors is the real cause of the outbreak, which include the legacy of slavery, colonial exploitation, illicit financial transactions, poverty, gender violence, and civil war.

The attack—coupled with new cases recorded in the city this weekend—have made Katwa the epicenter of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) Ebola outbreak.

""Attacks like this could undo the progress we have made. Despite this setback, we will keep working with the government, partners & communities to end this outbreak,"" said World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, on Twitter earlier this morning.

According to Reuters, MSF announced on Twitter today that the treatment center is closed. Today the ministry of health said a nurse died while trying to escape the fire, but the 10 patients housed in the center had all been safely relocated to other treatment centers.

The attack is the latest setback to Ebola response efforts. Since the outbreak began last August, several rebel groups of have attacked both health workers and clinics and spread misinformation about vaccination and Ebola transmission.

13 new cases in 3 days

Over the weekend and through today, the DRC recorded 13 new Ebola cases, 8 in Katwa and 5 in Butembo. Katwa has now surpassed Beni as having the most cases during this outbreak. There were also 12 deaths recorded, including 5 community death in Katwa.

""Katwa remains the main focus of the epidemic. In the last 21 days, 86 new confirmed cases were reported, of which 49 (57%) were reported in Katwa,"" The DRC health ministry said in its update yesterday.

""Katwa surpassed Beni in terms of number of cases and deaths. To date, Beni has reported 235 cases (226 confirmed and 9 probable) and 127 deaths while Katwa is 239 cases (228 confirmed and 11 probable) and 182 deaths.""

The mortality rate of cases in Katwa has also been markedly higher than in Beni, 76% versus 54%. Health officials said the difference is attributed to the higher percentage of community deaths and vaccination refusals in Katwa.

""This situation demonstrates the importance of increasing community engagement and active case finding in the community and health facilities in Katwa,"" the ministry said.

The new cases raise outbreak totals to 872 cases, of which 807 are confirmed and 65 are probable. There have also been 548 deaths, and 176 suspected cases are still under investigation.

Since the outbreak began, 83,517 people have been vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV in a ring vaccination campaign, including 21,357 in Katwa and 20,613 in Beni.

Phase 1 vaccine trials

Currently only Merck's unlicensed rVSV-ZEBOV has been okayed for use in the DRC. But today the Journal of Infectious Diseases published two phase 1 trials involving prime-boost Ebola vaccines, Ad26.ZEBOV, manufactured by Johnson & Johnson, and MVA-BN-Filo, made by Bavarian Nordic.

Both vaccines were well-tolerated and immunogenic up to a year in healthy volunteers from Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania.

And in other key developments, the DRC's health ministry reported three more cases, and World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said $148 million is urgently needed to support the Ebola response in the DRC. He also warned that without help from the global community, the country is at risk of backsliding in its efforts to contain the disease.

Work needed to build community trust

In a statement, MSF said the attack began at 10 pm on Feb 24 when unidentified assailants began throwing rocks at the 70-bed MSF-managed treatment center, which has admitted 602 patients, including 49 confirmed cases, since December.

Then the group set parts of the structure on fire, which destroyed medical wards and equipment. The brother of a patient died while trying to escape, though the exact circumstances of his death are still unclear, the group said.

Six patients with suspected Ebola and four with confirmed infections were transferred to other facilities, and all treatment center staff were evacuated.

Emmanuel Massart, MSF's emergency coordinator in Katwa, said in the statement, ""This attack was traumatic for patients, their relatives, and staff present inside the center at the time. This attack has crippled our ability to respond to what is now the epicenter of the outbreak.""

MSF said earlier Ebola outbreaks showed the importance of gaining community acceptance, and without the peoples' trust, the sick and dead remain hidden and health workers risk threats and attacks.

Meinie Nicolai, MSF's general director in the DRC's North Kivu province, said, ""Although the reasons behind the attack are unclear and such violence is unacceptable, what we know is that the actors of the Ebola response—MSF included—have failed to gain the trust of a significant part of the population.""

""All those involved in this response must change their approach and truly engage with the grievances and fears of the communities,"" she said.

Three new cases lift total to 875

Meanwhile, the DRC's health ministry today reported three new cases, one each from Mandima in Ituri province and from Vuhovi and Butembo in North Kivu province, raising the overall outbreak total to 875 cases, 810 of them confirmed and 65 listed as probable. Outbreak responders are still investigating 196 suspected cases.

Three more deaths were reported from Ebola, all from the same locations as the new cases and all of them people who died in community settings, a factor known to dramatically increase the risk of transmission. The newly reported deaths bring the fatality count to 551.

The health ministry said work continues to refine patient databases, which has resulted in reclassifying some cases based on where symptoms began, which it said isn't always easy to ascertain. For example, a patient from Katwa who fled to Bunia with her family and died in Komanda was reclassified as a Katwa case.

And in a related development, Lubero health officials today reported the detection of that area's first case, a woman from Katwa who was a contact of a known case and fled to Lubero after refusing treatment at the Ebola treatment center when she became ill. The woman died at Lubero General Regional Hospital. The ministry said her illness is classified as Katwa health zone, where her symptoms first appeared.

In a weekly update today, the WHO's African regional office said ongoing active local transmission continues, and over the past 21 days, 55% of new cases have been from Katwa and 25% from Butembo.

One new infection in a healthcare worker was reported last week, raising the total to 69, including 21 deaths.

Contact tracing is still under way in 15 health zones, where insecurity and pockets of community resistance are still a problem. The WHO said efforts are ongoing to beef up contact follow-up in Vuhovi, where violence recently disrupted response activities.

Funds needed for unprecedented challenges

In making a plea for more funds from international donors for the Ebola response today, Tedros said so far, only $10 million has been pledged. According to the WHO statement, he will travel to the DRC next week to meet the country's president in Kinshasa before visiting the two current epicenters, Butembo and Katwa.

""The situation is unprecedented: there has never been an Ebola outbreak in these conditions, with such a highly mobile population and with many gaps in the health system,"" he said.

Security is another major concern, Tedros said, adding that he is deeply saddened by the attack on the MSF facility in Katwa. Despite the tough challenges, he said the DRC and its partners have made major gains and averted hundreds or maybe even thousands of deaths, with more than 80,000 people vaccinated and more than 400 Ebola patients treated.

However, he warned that Ebola could spread from Butembo and Katwa to even more volatile areas that almost no partners could reach. Tedros praised generous technical and financial support that's already come from donors.

""We now need them to join us in the final push. No country or partner can face this deadly virus alone. The impact on public health and the economic ramifications can expand far beyond one country or continent.""

Feb 26 WHO African regional office weekly report",no result found,no result found,no result found,"On the last day of January, while most everyone who works on or worries about Ebola had their eyes trained on the latest dangerous outbreak, one of the world’s leading experts on the virus quietly retired.

Dr. Pierre Rollin, who has more Ebola field experience than almost anyone on the planet, shared a cake with close colleagues and cleared out his office at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He sent co-workers an email citing the lyrics to “My Way,” explaining he wanted the song to play when the email was opened but could not “find someone young enough to know how to do it.”

And then, after 26 storied years with the agency, Rollin took his leave.

advertisement

Rollin had been deputy branch chief of viral special pathogens, the team at the CDC that handles the deadliest known viruses, as well as the head of epidemiology for that group. A physician by training, he worked in the highest-security laboratories, studying what Ebola viruses do when they infect. But he also did much, much more.

He is renowned among the hardcore community of people who work on Ebola (and on Marburg fever, a related virus) as a jack-of-all-trades, someone who is able and willing to do nearly anything that needs to be done during an outbreak.

Stay up late into the night entering data? Not a problem. Dig a grave? Someone has to. Explain infection control to the staff at a local hospital? Great idea. Trap animals to try to see where Ebola hides in nature? Why not?

His former boss at the CDC, Dr. Inger Damon, recounted having seen a photo of Rollin’s legs sticking out from under a truck he was repairing; the picture was taken during a 1993 hantavirus outbreak in the United States.

“He is unusual in that way. He has incredibly diverse knowledge. And then he’s just willing to do it,” said Dr. Dan Bausch, who worked for Rollin at the CDC from 1996 to 2003. “Another person would say, ‘I’m not here, damn it, to go out and dig a grave.’ … And Pierre was always willing to do whatever needed to be done.”

Many of the people Rollin worked with over the years, in outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or Angola, Mali or Uganda, are having a hard time picturing the field without him.

“He’s just a giant,” said Dr. Mike Ryan, a veteran of outbreak responses who is assistant director of the emergency preparedness and response program at the World Health Organization. “Pierre has been a constant presence in the world of emerging diseases for well over three decades. … His dedication to this task has been super human. He’s an incredible brain, incredible mind, incredible heart.”

“It’s hard to speak of him without going into hyperbole, you know?”

Rollin declined a request for an interview with STAT. But friends from the field said he had discussed the possibility of moving on for several years. Outbreak responses these days had become more centralized than they were in the past, with the people assigned to response teams bringing more specialized expertise. And Rollin didn’t enjoy the new normal.

In videotaped interviews about his career recorded for the Global Health Chronicles — a CDC and Emory University collaboration to memorialize public health responses — Rollin said he was “grumpy” about the way things had changed.

“We used to be able to do everything. That’s how I was trained. There is no way I can train anybody else to do the same thing now, because the same thing doesn’t exist,” he said. “It’s a new normal but I liked the old normal much better.”

When STAT asked to interview him on his retirement, Rollin said he didn’t want to talk about himself. “I think I was only a ‘brick in the wall’ and nobody deserves to be a star,” he said in a brief email.

But others in his field — people who have worked with and learned from Rollin in outbreak after outbreak, who quarreled and laughed with him, tested blood samples and dug graves with him — were not willing to let his retirement pass without paying tribute to his contribution.

“We are all replaceable,” said Dr. Heinz Feldmann, who led the research into the development of the experimental Ebola vaccine being used in the current outbreak in DRC and who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ virology laboratory in Hamilton, Mont.

But, he added, it “will take a long time to find someone like him who knows every area pretty well and has been out in the field so many times.”

Rollin, who is 66, was born to French parents in Morocco when the North African country was still a colony. When he was a teenager, the family — he is one of eight children — moved back to France. He initially planned to study to be a veterinarian, but switched to human medicine. One of his professors got him interested in epidemiology, sparking a curiosity about zoonoses — the diseases, like Ebola or West Nile, that pass from animals to people.

He was later hired at the Paris-based Pasteur Institute, where he had encounters with many of the greats of virology, including Karl Johnson, who led the response to the first Ebola outbreak and who named the virus.

In 1989, Rollin went to the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases — USAMRIID — at Fort Detrick, in Maryland, to do postdoctoral work. He arrived at a career-shaping time.

Research monkeys imported from the Philippines were dying horrifically in a quarantine station at Reston, Va. Testing revealed they were infected with a new type of Ebola — now known as Reston ebolavirus. At the time, no one knew if this type of Ebola could transmit to people; the only two other types known then, Zaire and Sudan, were fearsome killers. (It turned out Reston ebolaviruses can infect but do not sicken people.)

Dr. C.J. Peters, the legendary virologist, was head of USAMRIID’s disease assessment division and was running the response. Rollin was pressed into service.

“And he must have liked it because after I took the job at CDC” — Peters was named head of viral special pathogens at CDC a couple of years later — “and Pierre approached me for a job. And I was only too glad to have him,” Peters said.

Peters said that working with Rollin was not always a joyride. He could be a “handful” to manage.

“I think he’s great — although there have been times when I would like to have wrung his neck.” (That may be a characteristic common to people drawn to this type of work. When STAT wrote about Peters last year, Johnson described Peters in much the same way.)

Peters, who is now retired, said Rollin would look at a situation in which “people may think that it’s X and Pierre’s going to think it’s Y. And that is actually one of his strong points, I think.”

The downside: “If you had a little plan that you had drawn up to do something and there was a hole in the plan, Pierre would find it and tell you about it,” Peters recalled.

Surely that, though, was for the best? “Yes, it’s the best thing. But it doesn’t feel good while you’re having it done,” he noted.

Rollin shared something else with Peters: a preference to be where the action was, not home and close to bosses.

“I was very happy when I was in the field. I was very disappointed when I was here,” he told the Global Health Chronicles project, describing the West African Ebola outbreak. In a stint in Atlanta during the two-year outbreak, Rollin spent a month-and-a-half working in the CDC’s emergency operations center — the hub from which emergency responses are run. “It’s hell,” he said.

“Pierre Rollin is really boots on the ground,” said Gary Kobinger, who has shared many field experiences with Rollin.

Bausch, who also worked with him on many Ebola and Marburg outbreaks over several decades, said the only thing Rollin had trouble handling was bureaucracy.

“Where he would really blossom is when you got into the field with him — because he got away from the mothership. He could have a little bit of room to do things,” said Bausch, director of the U.K. Public Health Rapid Support Team, a partnership between Public Health England and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Though Rollin was often the most experienced person on a response team, he didn’t pull rank.

“He would be the first guy to take the worst bed or the worst room,” said Bausch, who often ended up sharing a room with Rollin in whatever accommodations could be scrounged up during outbreaks, which often occur in remote and low-resource settings. “He really was not arrogant at all in that way, and very sacrificing for the team.”

Epidemiologists and others, including Rollin (second from left), gather in Uganda during the nation’s Ebola outbreak in 2012. CDC

In outbreak after outbreak, colleagues said, Rollin was an invaluable resource for others.

Kobinger, who led the work to develop the experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp, said people would seek out Rollin when something was going wrong, “and he’d come up with a story that was 10 times worse.” The upshot is the person would walk away feeling things weren’t so bad after all, said Kobinger, who is director of the Infectious Disease Research Center at Laval University in Quebec.

Rollin was known for putting in long hours in the field, but also having the handy skill of being able to nap anywhere, anytime. A snooze in a meeting was not unknown.

Under Peters, Rollin became the head of the pathogenesis section at the CDC. His friends said he is very good diagnostician and is adept in a BSL-4 lab, the high-containment laboratories where scientists work on the deadliest pathogens. “Very good with his hands in doing that work,” said Bausch, who learned BSL-4 technique from Rollin.

If Rollin was good with viruses, he was equally as good with people. Damon, his former CDC boss, recalled that when one of the nurses from Dallas who had been infected with Ebola in 2014 gave birth well after she had recovered from the virus, there were still niggling concerns about whether she could infect others. So Rollin flew out to be on site, just in case.

“That’s just the kind of guy he is,” Damon said.

There are fewer and fewer all-rounders like Rollin in the outbreak response community and some see his retirement — which he has been threatening for several years — as almost an end of an era. Kobinger noted that last spring, during an outbreak on western DRC, everyone wanted to take a selfie with Rollin, figuring it might be his last.

Rollin was briefly in the field during the current outbreak in northeastern DRC, back in August when the response was just starting up. A violent incident in the area — one of many that has plagued this outbreak response — prompted the State Department to order U.S. government employees to leave. They haven’t been allowed back since, though Rollin did spend time in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, advising the health ministry.

In retirement, Rollin plans to split his time between a family farm in France and Atlanta, where his wife, Dominique, still works for the CDC. But many of his friends and colleagues are hoping his leave isn’t permanent, and wonder if he’ll end up working for Doctors Without Borders or some other entity that would take him back to the field.

“Somehow I can’t see Pierre retiring to the Camargue for long periods of time,” Peters remarked."

""Tonight another deplorable attack on an Ebola treatment facility has taken place, this time in the city of Butembo,"" said Hugues Robert, MSF emergency desk manager, in a news release. ""This follows the attack last week on another MSF Ebola treatment center in nearby Katwa. This attack has not only put the lives of Ebola patients and their families in danger, but also those of MSF and Ministry of Health staff.""

Currently there is no word from MSF on the number of fatalities and injuries, if any. MSF's ETC in Katwa was set afire on Feb 24, and MSF was forced to suspend activities there yesterday.

The Butembo ETC is the largest built in the 8 months the DRC has battled an Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, with new cases announced daily.

The region is home to dozens of paramilitary and rebel forces, most notably the Allied Democratic Forces. Since the outbreak began last August, numerous outbursts of violence against healthcare workers and attacks on clinics have been reported. The rebel forces have also conducted disinformation campaigns about how Ebola is transmitted and treated.

According to data from MSF, as of Jan 27, the Butembo ETC had admitted 1,400 patients, with Beni's ETC (1,370 admissions) the second busiest. And the Butembo center had confirmed 197 Ebola patients, compared with 41 at the Beni ETC.

The Katwa ETC, before the attack this week, had admitted 602 patients, including 49 confirmed cases, since December, according to an MSF update yesterday.

New wave of violence

Butembo, along with Katwa, is one of the most active Ebola hot spots, reporting several new cases in recent days.

The Katwa ETC attack resulted in one fatality. The 10 Ebola patients in treatment at the clinic, however, were safely transported to other ETCs. Yesterday, MSF said the Katwa ETC would be closed indefinitely.

On Feb 20, officials in the DRC said a nurse had been abducted and murdered in Vuhovi.

The incidents may represent a new wave of violence that follows spikes of Ebola activity. In the early months of the outbreak, the violence was focused in Beni and Mblanka, the first cities to face the deadly virus.

According to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Ebola dashboard, officials recorded 4 more cases today in the outbreak, raising the outbreak total to 879 infections, 814 of which have been confirmed. Death totals remain at 551.

Feb 26 CIDRAP News story ""MSF suspends work at Katwa Ebola center as WHO seeks more support""",no result found,no result found,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Armed assailants attacked an Ebola centre in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday, setting off a fire and becoming embroiled in an extended gunbattle with security forces that has yet to end, the local mayer said.

The identity and motive of the assailants were unclear. Aid workers have faced mistrust fueled by widespread rumours in some areas as they work to contain the Ebola outbreak.

Dozens of armed militia also regularly attack civilians and security forces in eastern Congo’s borderlands with Uganda and Rwanda, which has significantly hampered the response to the disease.

Wednesday’s attack in the city of Butembo was the second in Congo’s Ebola-hit east. On Sunday unidentified assailants set fire to another treatment centre in the nearby town of Katwa, killing a nurse.

“After the attack... in Katwa, we decided to reinforce the security of these structures. That is why there is an exchange of fire between the police and the assailants,” Butembo mayor Sylvain Mbusa Kanyamanda told Reuters.

“Elements from the Congolese army have been deployed to contain the situation. As the operations continue, I do not have a casualty toll for the moment,” he said.

The current Ebola outbreak, first declared last August, is the second deadliest of the haemorrhagic fever since it was discovered in Congo in 1976. It is believed to have killed at least 551 people so far and infected over 300 more.

28-Feb-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity. Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while simultaneously, small clusters continue to occur in various geographically dispersed locations. During the last 21 days (6 – 26 February 2019), 77 new cases have been reported from 33 health areas within nine health zones (Figure 1), including: Katwa (45), Butembo (19), Vuhovi (4), Kyondo (3), Kalunguta (2), Oicha (1), Beni (1), Mandima (1), and Rwampara (1).

Although there are decreasing trends in case incidence (Figure 2), the high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases and relatively low number of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance could increase the risk of further chains of transmission in affected communities. Response teams must maintain a high degree of vigilance across all areas with declining case incidence and contact tracing activity, as well as in areas with active cases, to rapidly detect new cases and prevent onward transmission. Following attacks this week on the treatment centres in Katwa and Butembo, WHO is working with partners to ensure the safety of the patients and staff. These incidents are disruptive to the response on many levels and can also hamper surveillance activities in the field.

As of 26 February, 879 EVD cases1 (814 confirmed and 65 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (499) were female and 30% (264) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 119 of 301 health areas across 19 health zones. Overall, 553 deaths (case fatality ratio: 63%) have been reported and as of 19 February 2019, 257 survivors have been reported. There is ongoing cleaning of the case database to correct the number deaths and survivors discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs).

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. National and regional risk levels remain very high, though global risk levels remain low. This EVD outbreak is affecting primarily the north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons, as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria, measles), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the fragile security situation in North Kivu and Ituri, further limits the implementation of response activities.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

For more information, see:

Along with fresh details about the attack, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the events deplorable and warned that the aftermath could increase transmission.

MSF suspends patient care in hot spot

MSF said assailants set some of the Butembo compound's facilities and vehicles on fire, and while the blazes were contained and no staff or patients were hurt, teams were forced to stop patient care. The nonprofit the ETC housed 57 patients at the time, including 15 with confirmed Ebola infections. All patients still in the ETC were transferred to a transit center.

Given a similar attack on an MSF facility in Katwa 3 days earlier that killed a caregiver, ""MSF has evacuated staff from the area for their safety pending a thorough analysis of the risks associated with continuing to provide medical care there,"" the organization said in a news release.

Hugues Robert, MSF emergency desk manager, said in the release that the attacks endanger not only the lives of its staff members, but also the most vulnerable people at the heart of the response: the patients.

""In light of these two violent incidents, we have no choice but to suspend our activities until further notice,"" he said. ""As medical responders, it is very painful to have to leave behind patients, their families, and other members of the community at such a critical time in the Ebola response.""

MSF also manages Ebola activities in the North Kivu province towns of Kayna, Luberu, and Goma and operates two Ebola isolation facilities in the Ituri province cities of Bwanasura and Bunia.

WHO: Deplorable, disrespectful attacks

In a statement today, the WHO said the attacks affect people's lives and increase the risk of disease spread. ""They are profoundly disrespectful of the dedicated work of local, regional and international responders,"" the agency said.

WHO and its partners are working to ensure patient and staff safety, and efforts are under way to expand the Katwa transit center where patients at the damaged ETCs have been moved. A top priority is quality clinical care for patients, and staff are working to find four patients who fled during the violence the WHO said.

Though MSF and WHO staff are safe, security services sustained casualties, the WHO added. The group also said it is working closely with partners to determine steps to ensure the overall Ebola response is maintained.

In a separate statement summarizing the latest outbreak trends, the WHO said Katwa and Butembo are the areas of highest concern, though small clusters of cases continue to pop up across a broad area.

Though cases show a decreasing trend, the high proportion of community deaths and relatively low number of new cases from known contacts increase the risk of more transmission chains in affected communities, the agency said. And it worries that the attack on Katwa and Butembo ETCs could disrupt field activities.

Attack caused 32 patients to flee

Late yesterday, the DRC's health ministry shared new details about the attack on the Butembo ETC, which it said involved unidentified gunmen.

Of the suspected patients, 32 fled, and, of the confirmed patients, most were found in their single rooms. But 4 fled, and efforts are under way to find them. The health ministry said all patients and medical staff are safe, and the patients were temporarily taken to a Butembo transit center run by the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA).

The attack came just 3 days after a similar event in Katwa at another MSF ETC, less than a week since a nurse was abducted and killed in Vuhovi.

Cases grow to 885, with surge expected

Meanwhile, the outbreak total continues to grow, and in updates yesterday and today the health ministry reported 10 more cases, including 8 in Katwa, 1 in Butembo, and 1 in Kalunguta. The patient from Kalunguta is a known contact of an individual from Katwa who refused follow-up and vaccination.

The latest cases push the overall number to 885, which includes 820 confirmed and 65 probable cases. Health officials are also investigating 227 suspected cases.

Also, 4 more people died from their infections, 2 in Katwa and 1 each in Butembo and Kalunguta. All occurred in community settings, a factor known to increase the risk of transmission. Outbreak fatalities have now reached 555.

In today's update, the ministry said Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, the country's health minister, along with a WHO representative from the DRC, visited Butembo today. The visit included the two ETC arson targets, to assess the situation on the ground.

Kalenga said the incidents have greatly disrupted the Ebola response, and the attacks and threats have significantly slowed the Ebola response, especially contact follow-up, alert investigations, vaccination of contact, and infection prevention and control activities.

""Thus, it will be expected a significant upsurge of cases in health areas of Katwa and Butembo in the coming days,"" officials said, adding that Kalenga met with field teams to reassure them that they have full health ministry support. In meeting with Butembo's mayor today, Kalenga said the Ebola epidemic will be impossible to control without security assurances for field workers.

The identity and motive of the assailants were unclear. Aid workers have faced mistrust in some areas as they work to contain an Ebola outbreak.

Dozens of armed militia also regularly attack civilians and security forces in eastern Congo’s borderlands with Uganda and Rwanda, which has significantly hampered the response to the disease.

The health ministry said in a statement that 38 suspected Ebola patients and 12 confirmed cases were in the center at the time of the attack. Four of the patients with confirmed cases fled and are being looked for, it said.

None of the patients who have been accounted for were injured, nor were any staff members, the ministry added.

French medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), which runs the center together with the ministry, condemned the “deplorable attack” and said its efforts were focused on the immediate safety of patients and staff.

The attack in the city of Butembo was the second in Congo’s Ebola-hit east this week. On Sunday unidentified assailants set fire to a treatment center in the nearby town of Katwa, killing a nurse.

The World Bank support follows an urgent request request from World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, earlier this week for $148 million to support the Ebola response in the DRC. Earlier this week, the WHO said Tedros would visit the DRC, including the main epicenters of Katwa and Butembo. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the visit is still scheduled.

Tedros had warned that without help from the global community the country is at risk of backsliding in its progress to contain the disease.

Though cases over the past few weeks have shown a decreasing trend, fresh attacks on Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) in hot spots in Katwa and Butembo drove some confirmed patients into the community when they fled the violence, have led Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to evacuate ETC staff and have significantly slowed the response.

In addition, the DRC health minister said yesterday that officials expect a surge of cases in the affected areas.

World Bank outbreak support

Of the $80 million in support from the World Bank, $60 million is in grants and credits through the International Development Association, a fund for low-income countries.

Also, a $20 million grant was approved by the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF), specialty bonds that were launched in 2017 to streamline surge funding to developing countries facing pandemic threats. The financing tool was created by the World Bank along with Japan, Germany, and Australia.

According to the World Bank statement, the group approved the PEF grant within 3 days of receiving a request from the DRC government. Half will be released immediately to fund the frontline response, with the rest released within a month or sooner, as needed.

The first PEF funds were tapped in May 2018 during the DRC's previous Ebola outbreak in Equateur province.

In the statement, World Bank interim president and CEO Kristalina Georgieva said, ""Our priority is to halt this outbreak of Ebola and limit the devastation it causes to families and communities. Today's commitment ensures that lifesaving work can be urgently scaled up, and that lack of funding is not a constraint.""

Scrambling to care for patients

In the wake of the two ETC attacks, MSF evacuated its staff from the hot spot. And according to the health ministry, another aid group—the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA)—is pulling their staff as well over security concerns. ALIMA runs a transit center in Butembo, and Ebola patients were taken there after the attack on the on the city's MSF ETC.

However, intensive efforts are under way to use the Butembo MSF facility again as soon as possible. The health ministry said doctors, nurses, and hygienists working in the ETC and the transit center, where suspected patients await their test results, are local health workers, and despite the two attacks, many have returned to their jobs to care for Ebola patients.

The WHO's African regional office said today on its Twitter account that the Butembo ETC has been decontaminated, and teams from the WHO, UNICEF, and the DRC's health ministry are redeploying a local MSF hygienist to prepare the unit for immediate use.

For now, the only functioning patient care facility is the transit center within Katwa Reference General Hospital, according to the health ministry. With modifications, the transit center has beds for 35 patients, and 31 are currently occupied by 12 confirmed and 19 suspected patients. Efforts are under way to add 10 more beds.

All patients with confirmed infections who fled during the Butembo attack have been found and are admitted to the transit center, officials said.

In a related development, International Medical Corps (IMC) said today on its Twitter account that it is still providing training and supplies to healthcare workers and is supporting screening for Ebola symptoms in Butembo and Katwa.

Outbreak total climbs to 888

Meanwhile, in its daily update today, the DRC health ministry reported three new cases, two in Katwa and one in Mandima. Officials are also investigating 174 suspected cases. The latest confirmed cases lift the outbreak total to 888, which included 823 confirmed and 65 probable cases.

Two more people died from Ebola, both from Katwa, including one who died in the community, raising the number of deaths to 557.

Mar 1 DRC update","The medical NGO Doctors Without Borders has suspended its work at the epicentre of the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Two of its clinics were burned down, in the latest attack against aid workers trying to contain the dangerous virus.

Ebola is believed to have killed more than 550 people in the latest outbreak - the worst in DRC history.

Al Jazeera's Alexi O'Brien reports.",no result found,no result found,"An Ebola treatment center in Katwa, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where operations have been suspended following an attack on the facility.

Attacks that badly damaged two Ebola treatment centers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo this week have left the World Health Organization, the country’s Health Ministry, and some other partners scrambling to find ways to care for Ebola patients in the area where the outbreak continues to rage.

Both Doctors Without Borders and ALIMA, the medical organizations that were running the operations, have withdrawn their personnel because of the danger they faced.

The WHO will remain, but is drawing up contingency plans for reducing or withdrawing staff if the violence continues, Dr. Michel Yao, head of the agency’s Ebola response in the DRC, told STAT on Friday.

“For the time being, we are not withdrawing,” Yao said. “But of course we are working on different contingency plans. If the situation worsens, we would not put at risk our staff. We would have to at least reduce or withdraw.”

The current outbreak is now in its eighth month. To date, 885 people have been infected and 555 have died, making this the second largest on record.

The epidemic has been highly challenging to contain because it is occurring in what is effectively a war zone. Progress has been slow, with small gains generally followed by setbacks that have occurred when violence has broken out in the affected provinces of North Kivu and Ituri.

For months, the violence was mainly directed at DRC army forces or at the United Nations peacekeeping operation that has been in the region for years. Recently, however, Ebola response workers and facilities have been targeted at Katwa and Butembo, the transmission hot spots.

Workers administering vaccine, who trace the contacts of known cases and others who disinfect homes of known cases, have been attacked. “The teams are now scared,” Yao said, acknowledging the violence is affecting morale.

On Sunday, unknown attackers set fire to an Ebola treatment center at Katwa operated by Doctors Without Borders, destroying all the facility’s generators in the process. On Wednesday, armed attackers torched the treatment center at Butembo, destroying the equipment used to store Ebola medications at the proper temperature.

Both treatment centers are now unusable, though the WHO and others are trying to see if they can be rebuilt.

Eleven patients who were confirmed to have Ebola and who were being treated in the facilities have been transferred to a 40-bed transit center within a Katwa hospital where people suspected of having Ebola are cared for while they await test results.

Part of that facility has now been cordoned off for the care of the Ebola patients, Yao said. But ALIMA, which operated the transit center, has also withdrawn its workers, leaving WHO and others to struggle to provide enough medical staff to care for them.

Yao said there aren’t enough trained staff to complete a day shift. “Without the involvement of … these partners, it will be quite difficult to give appropriate care,” he said.

WHO has asked the Congolese government to bolster the security it provides the Ebola response workers in the hopes that ALIMA and Doctors Without Borders can be persuaded to return. The remaining response teams need to be kept safe so that they can resume work to control the outbreak. Yao acknowledged, though, that a “militarization” of the response could further undermine community acceptance of the Ebola response teams and their methods.

He said it’s not clear why the response is being targeted.

“This kind of violence we cannot understand. We think maybe it’s a kind of manipulation to achieve some other objective. But we don’t really understand why these teams were attacked,” he said.

There has been grumbling on social media about the region being “invaded by foreigners,” he said. “But in our team we have more nationals, more locals, than internationals. Internationals were actually to coach national colleagues who don’t have the experience.”

Earlier in the outbreak community resistance was intense in Beni, which was a hot spot in October and November. Cooperation improved markedly after people began to understand the threat posed by Ebola. Yao said health workers were starting to see that kind of shift in Katwa and Butembo before the recent attacks.

He said it will be critical to understand what is driving the violence. Failure to control the outbreak is unthinkable.

“If the disease spreads further and most of the partners withdraw, it will be a major disaster,” Yao said. “With Ebola, we have no option but to control it….We have to find the means.”"

Redfield will make the trip with the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, according to a WHO statement.

The CDC would not confirm Redfield’s travel plans. “To protect the safety of CDC staff, including leadership, we don’t confirm travel or discuss specific locations of deployed staff members,” spokeswoman Kate Grusich said in an email.

The CDC was forced to withdraw workers from the outbreak zone last year amid security concerns in the region, the scene of intense local conflicts. Those concerns have persisted; this week, two medical groups that were running the operations in the area decided to withdraw their personnel following attacks on Ebola treatment centers.

A spokeswoman for the WHO said the itinerary for the upcoming trip is still being finalized, but a statement earlier this week from the agency said Tedros, as the director-general is called, will visit the outbreak zone — specifically two cities where the treatment centers were recently attacked and burned. This will be at least the fourth visit to the outbreak zone by the director-general.

It is not clear if Redfield will accompany Tedros to those cities, Katwa and Butembo, where most of the Ebola transmission is now occurring in the outbreak, now in its eighth month. A State Department bar on U.S. government employees working in the outbreak zone is still in effect.

Redfield did visit North Kivu, the province in northeastern DRC where the outbreak began, back in August. Later that month U.S. government employees in the region, including a small team from the CDC, were pulled back after an attack on security forces. They were not allowed to return.

To date 888 people have been infected in this outbreak and 557 have died.

In an interview in October, Redfeld said that, in discussions with other Trump administration officials, he argued that American experts should stay in the outbreak zone, despite security risks, but was overruled.

The CDC director said he would like to see “a small footprint of CDC employees” back in the area. He added: “I’d be happy to be one of them.”

CDC employees have been deployed to other parts of the country during the outbreak. The agency’s experts have spent time in Kinshasa, the Congolese capital, advising the health ministry, for example.

Since this outbreak began, 168 CDC employees have been deployed to DRC, neighboring countries or to WHO headquarters, Grusich said. And other U.S.-based personnel have been working with the Congolese health ministry, providing guidance on matters such as case investigation, contact tracing, and community engagement.

More staff may be heading to DRC soon. In early February, Redfield issued a call to agency staff for volunteers for “extended deployments” to DRC, surrounding countries, and to WHO headquarters in Geneva. “We are in need of CDC staff with experience working in Africa, knowledge about Ebola, and ideally advanced French language skills,” he wrote."

Aid workers have faced mistrust in some areas as they work to contain the Ebola outbreak, which has become the worst in Congo’s history.

The ministry said the Butembo treatment center reopened on Saturday. “For now it is managed by the ministry in collaboration with the World Health Organization and UNICEF,” it said in a statement.

So far 12 patients confirmed to have Ebola have been admitted. Without Doctors Without Borders, who staffed the ETC before the attack, the center is being run by workers from the ministry of health, the Word Health Organization (WHO), and UNICEF.

The ministry of health also said construction is set to begin today on a new ETC in Katwa. The former ETC was also targeted by arsons last week.

The DRC also noted today that it has implemented an action plan to end community disruptions to officials' outbreak response efforts.

The developments have occurred against a backdrop of 8 new cases and almost 900 since the outbreak began in August 2018.

Shift of violence

In the latest bulletin from the WHO's African regional office, the WHO said the arson attacks are a major setback and represent a shift of violence in the region.

""In Butembo, where security incidents occurred on 27 February 2019, the proportion of contact follow-up decreased to 66% against an average of 76% in the previous seven days. In Vuhovi, the proportion of contacts followed on 2 March 2019 was 29% as a result of security conditions that prevented response activities and contact follow-up,"" the WHO said.

The virus still has a stronghold over Katwa and Butembo. Over the weekend, the DRC recorded 6 more Ebola cases: 3 in Katwa, 2 in Mandima, and 1 in Butembo. There were also four deaths, three of which occurred in Katwa.

Today the DRC's update noted 2 new cases and 2 deaths, all in Butembo. One of the new deaths happened in the community, which raises the risk of further disease spread.

The developments bring the outbreak total to 897 cases and 563 deaths, representing a case-fatality rate of 63%.

""Katwa Health Zone remains the main hot spot, reporting 62% (48/78) of the new confirmed cases in the past 21 days,"" the WHO said. ""As of 2 March 2019, 14 of the 18 health areas in Katwa Health Zone reported confirmed cases in the past 21 days. Katwa, Butembo, Kaluguta and Mandima health zones have reported new confirmed cases in the past three days and remain points of attention.""

The DRC added today, ""The two health zones that continue to fuel this epidemic remain Butembo and Katwa, which reported more than 86% of new confirmed cases in the last 21 days. In the last 21 days, 80 new cases have been reported, including 48 in Katwa (60%) and 21 in Butembo (26.25%).""

In an encouraging trend, no new confirmed Ebola cases have been reported for 21 day in 11 of the 19 affected health zones (Biena, Kayna, Komanda, Mabalako, Manguredjipa, Msereka, Musienene, Mutwanga, Nyakunde, Oicha, and Tchomia). Another six health zones had one to four cases (Beni, Kalunguta, Kyondo, Mandima. Rwampara, and Vuhovi), the DRC said today.

Study estimates HCW vaccination impact

According to the DRC ministry of health today, 85,375 people have been vaccinated against Ebola, including 21,892 in Katwa, 20,740 in Beni, 10,628 in Butembo, and 6,109 in Mabalako

A new study published in Epidemics used data collected from 12 previous Ebola outbreaks to simulate the impact of healthcare worker vaccination on outbreak size and disease transmission. The study found that at 30% vaccine coverage, health worker vaccination had an impact on disease transmission in two types of simulated outbreaks.

Mar 2 DRC report","The international aid charity, Doctors Without Borders (MSF), has suspended its operations in the wake of Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) after two of its treatment centres were attacked.

Now there are concerns the disease will spread to neighbouring countries, including South Sudan. More than 500 people have died from Ebola in DRC since August.

Al Jazeera's Hiba Morgan reports from the town of Yei in South Sudan, close to the Congolese border.",no result found,"YAOUNDE (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Aid workers at the epicenter of the worst Ebola epidemic in the history of the Democratic Republic of Congo say they are facing a spike in attacks and threats, slowing their work and potentially triggering a surge of new cases.

While two Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) facilities treating Ebola patients in North Kivu province were attacked last week, aid workers said they are only the latest in a series of incidents.

One of the facilities has since reopened.

“We had at least 10 cars that were broken into in Katwa,” said Michel Yao, incident manager for the World Health Organization referring to an attack last month in an area in the eastern trading hub of Butembo, a city with strong links to neighboring Uganda.

“There are increasing attacks on different teams,” Yao told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone from Butembo.

He cited the difficult conditions faced by aid staff working on disinfection, safe burials, support of health facilities, those providing vaccinations to treat Ebola and others.

The current Ebola epidemic, first declared in August, is believed to have killed at least 561 people, so far, and infected over 300 more.

It is unclear who exactly is behind the attacks, said Jean-Philippe Marcoux, country director for the Mercy Corps charity in Congo.

“It’s a minority of groups but sometimes they react violently and target response workers,” he said.

“To a certain extent, Ebola has been politicized during the run up to (December’s presidential) elections,” said Marcoux.

Some communities believe the Ebola response to be part of a political conspiracy to control or exclude the local population from the electoral process, he said.

Some people accuse the government or the international community of “bringing us Ebola”, Marcoux said.

In some neighborhoods, locals ignore potentially life-saving precautions, Marcoux added.

“They refuse treatment, they refuse follow ups, they refuse vaccinations and they refuse assistance for the (safe) burials.”

“The teams and staff are very scared,” WHO’s Yao said. “When our team enters (certain areas), they are suddenly surrounded by hostile people who are even armed.”

“We saw bullet marks on the wall,” Yao added, referring to an attack on an Ebola treatment center in Butembo on Wednesday.

The center was set on fire while an extended gun battle between the attackers and security forces ensued, health officials said.

The torching of the two centers prompted Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) to suspend medical activities.

“It will definitively affect the prognosis of people surviving Ebola,” Yao said.

“The fear is that if we cannot work in the coming days and weeks, we will have a major surge of cases in Butembo. I cannot exclude re-infection in places where the outbreak has been brought under control. This is really our fear.”

Blaming the attacks on insecurity and violent gangs “would be too easy,” said Marcoux in a statement released on Thursday.

“Building community acceptance and securing trust has not being given the same weight as treatment, and we are continuing to see the consequences - suspicion abounds and case numbers rise,” he added.

“The only way around it is to establish dialogue, which takes time, resources, and with the right people that (communities) can trust - that would be a good place to start.”",no result found

Seven new cases were recorded today: two each in Katwa and Mandima, and one each in Butembo and Masereka. A total of 223 suspected cases are still under investigation. The health ministry also noted one probable case in a woman from Masereka who died 1 day after her husband's death.

The health ministry also recorded 3 new deaths, including community deaths in Mandima and Masereka. Since August, there have been 569 deaths.

Yesterday the DRC recorded 3 new cases, raising the total number of cases, 2 in Katwa and 1 in Masereka. Officials also confirmed 2 deaths yesterday, 1 in the community in Masereka and 1 in the Mangina Ebola treatment center (ETC). Deaths in the community raise the risk of further disease spread.

Regrouping after fires

The cases come as officials continue to regroup and reorganize after two ETCs were burned in recent weeks in the outbreak's main hot spots, Katwa and Butembo.

Late yesterday DRC officials said community talks continue in Butembo to better bridge the gap between health workers and community members who have shown reluctance to the Ebola response.

""The fact that the response teams were accompanied by the police in less secure areas was perceived with suspicion,"" the DRC said in a summary of the meetings. ""Some local health providers who were not directly involved in the response have intoxicated the community by spreading messages that are contrary to the messages of the response teams.""

Also yesterday, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, PhD, the DRC's minister of health, held a press conference in Kinshasa. While he said he expected the outbreak to be over in most health zones in the coming weeks, Butembo and Katwa remain a threat to the rest of the region.

Kalenga said the violent attacks on ETCs in those towns shows a ""dangerously intense"" local response to outbreak and health workers.

Though no one was seriously injured in Butembo's ETC fire, the attack caused Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to pull staff from the area.

The DRC also provided the latest vaccination numbers today. Since August, a total of 85,867 people have been vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, including 21,953 in Katwa, and 10,785 in Butembo.

Violence tied to breakdown of trust

In a commentary today in the New England Journal of Medicine, Vinh-Kim Nguyen, MD, a medical team leader for MSF working in Kayna, DRC, said an epidemic of suspicion exists among local populations and outbreak response workers.

Nguyen said some local community members see workers as ""Ebola profiteers""—interested only in stopping the spread of the virus and doing little to treat or correct other serious health problems, including malaria, cholera, and typhoid.

The recent attacks in Katwa and Butembo ""resonate with prevailing anger driven by the perception that the Riposte's [international response's] massive funding is not being adequately redistributed and is largely benefiting outsiders,"" Nguyen writes.

""In this setting, crucial outreach activities, such as identifying cases and ensuring safe and dignified burials, can be dangerous. Tense and occasionally violent standoffs between frightened residents and response teams are a routine occurrence. So in areas deemed insecure, outreach workers and vaccination teams are being accompanied by armed military escorts.""

Nguyen said outbreak responders have learned a great deal since West Africa's 2014-16 Ebola epidemic, including placing more emphasis on engaging the local communities. Still, he adds, mistrust remains, fueled in part by a growing global mistrust of scientists.

He concludes, ""State-of-the-art medical interventions won't be enough without serious efforts to rebuild trust, informed by social science rather than pious liturgies.""

Wellcome Trust increases funding

Today the Wellcome Trust announced it would be giving £2 million ($2.65 million US) to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the government of the DRC to support vaccine research in the DRC.

""The Ebola virus has taken hold in an incredibly challenging region and recent attacks on treatment centres show that the security situation is a very real concern which will impact on the epidemic,"" said Jeremy Farrar, MD, PhD, director of Wellcome, in a press statement.

""The outbreak is in danger of spreading within the DRC, and if the international community doesn’t step up their support, there is real risk that this outbreak will get out of control, cross borders and take off as it did in the West African epidemic where over 11,000 people died.""

Long-lasting viral RNA in semen of survivors

Finally today, the New England Journal of Medicine also published a longitudinal study on Ebola survivors in Liberia, which showed the presence of Ebola RNA in semen for more than 3 years.

The study showed that, during 12 months following recovery, 966 survivors reported six symptoms more than controls: urinary frequency (14.7% vs 3.4%), headache (47.6% vs 35.6%), fatigue (18.4% vs 6.3%), muscle pain (23.1% vs 10.1%), memory loss (29.2% vs 4.8%), and joint pain (47.5% vs 17.5%). All but the urinary pain improved within 12 months.

The researchers also found that, among the 252 men who provided more than one semen sample, detection of viral RNA in semen was intermittent in 78 (31%). The time from acute illness to Ebola RNA detection was as long as 1,178 days, or about 39 months. The median was 551 days, or 18 months.

This was the first study to match Ebola survivors with controls who did not contract the virus but shared similar environmental exposures.

7-Mar-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity. Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while small clusters continue simultaneously in some geographically dispersed locations. During the last 21 days (13 February – 5 March 2019), 76 new confirmed and probable cases have been reported from 31 health areas within nine health zones (Figure 1), including: Katwa (44), Butembo (17), Mandima (6), Masereka (3), Kalunguta (2), Beni (1), Vuhovi (1), Kyondo (1), and Rwampara (1). The emerging cluster in Mandima health zone is occurring in a previously unaffected village, with five of the recent cases epidemiologically linked and the sixth case likely exposed in Butembo; nonetheless, there remains a high risk of further spread. Similarly, recent cases (two confirmed and one probable) in Masereka stem from a Butembo chain of transmission. These events highlight the importance for response teams to remain active across all areas, including those with lower case incidence, to rapidly detect new cases and prevent onward transmission.

As of 5 March, 907 EVD cases1 (841 confirmed and 66 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (514) were female and 30% (273) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 121 of 301 health areas across 19 health zones of the North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Overall, 569 deaths (case fatality ratio: 63%) have been reported, and 304 patients have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs). Although declining trends in case incidence are currently being observed, the high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs (related as well to recent violent incidents), and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, all increase the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and continued spread.

Following the attacks on two ETCs in Katwa and Butembo, patients were temporarily transferred to the Katwa Transit Centre. On 2 March, the Butembo ETC was rehabilitated and resumed treatment of EVD patients. Response teams are progressively resuming activities in all affected areas with the exception of two health areas where security and community resistance remain a challenge.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. National and regional risk levels remain very high, though global risk levels remain low. This EVD outbreak is primarily affecting the north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons, as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria, measles) and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the fragile security situation in North Kivu and Ituri, further limits the implementation of response activities.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

In other developments, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) health ministry today reported seven new Ebola cases and responded to concerns about the response, which today included a visit from top World Health Organization (WHO) officials.

MSF: Community grievances increasing

During the briefing, MSF officials said that, since the first of the year, 40% of the newly reported cases are people who died from Ebola in their communities and that in the current epicenter of Katwa and Butembo, 43% of the patients confirmed with the virus in the past 3 weeks have no known links to other cases, a sign of undetected transmission chains, which is bad news.

MSF recently pulled its staff from Kawta and Butembo following violent attacks on its Ebola treatment centers (ETCs), but it has maintained its operations in other parts of North Kivu province and in neighboring Ituri province.

MSF International President Joanne Liu, MD, said, ""We have a striking contradiction: On the one hand a rapid and large outbreak response with new medical tools such as vaccines and treatments that show promising outcomes when people come early—and on the other hand, people with Ebola are dying in their communities, and do not trust the Ebola response enough to come forward.""

Regarding the attacks on the two ETCs, MSF said it doesn't know the motives or identities of the attackers, but the violence follows escalating tensions in the outbreak area that have also included dozens of security incidents against response efforts in February.

""While the causes of these acts are not all the same, it is clear that various political, social and economic grievances are increasingly crystallising around the response,"" MSF said in a press release today.

Underlying issues fueling the tensions include a massive influx of financing focused only on Ebola in neglected areas suffering from long-standing conflict, violence, and healthcare gaps, postponed elections in the outbreak-hit area, and suspicions that Ebola is a political ploy.

Police and armed forces are being used to compel cooperation with Ebola response steps, such as safe burials, contact tracing, and treatment center admission, which MSF says further alienates the community and is counterproductive.

DRC health officials have stepped up community talks in Butembo to better understand the gap between health workers and community members, and Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, has acknowledged that using response teams accompanied by police in less secure areas has been perceived with suspicion. In an update today, the ministry also said it has gotten the message that community members want partners not only to fight Ebola, but also to improve general living conditions.

MSF said the Ebola response must change direction, and it had several suggestions, including giving disease management choices back to patients and their families, addressing communities' other dire health needs, and avoiding coercion tactics. And it urged even wider use of the vaccine, which has been administered to more than 86,000 people in the DRC.

Liu said Ebola is a brutal disease that breeds fear and isolation to patients, families, and health providers. ""The Ebola response needs to become patient and community centred. Patients must be treated as patients, and not as some kind of biothreat.""

DRC offials respond to criticisms

In its daily update, the DRC health ministry reported 7 new cases, including 5 in Katwa, 1 in Butembo, and 1 in Kyondo. The new illnesses lift the overall outbreak total to 913, which includes 848 confirmed and 65 probable cases.

Six more people died from their infections, including 3 in the community and 3 in ETCs, boosting the outbreak's fatality count to 574.

Also in the update, the health ministry pushed back on and clarified some perceptions of the outbreak. It said there's a misunderstanding about the role of law enforcement in the outbreak areas and that police and military are not involved in response activities and their role has never been to force compliance with sanitary measures.

Given numerous security incidents, the ministry said it asked the country's interior ministry to ensure the security of goods, services, and people in the area. ""It is unacceptable for health workers to be threatened and assaulted in the course of their work,"" the officials said. ""Likewise, it is unacceptable that families are prevented from burying their relative in a dignified and secure manner because of groups of unseemly people.""

Because local health workers can't be pulled when security deteriorates, increased security is needed to keep the response going, the ministry said. It added that community members have demanded overall security improvements across the area and that a return to security is one of MSF's conditions for returning to Butembo and Katwa.

WHO officials, including Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, arrived in Kinshasa today, where Kalenga received them and thanked them for their field work, especially their role in rehabilitating ETCs in Katwa and Butembo that were damaged in violent attacks.

Though the outbreak isn't under control, the ministry said progress so far is remarkable, given population movements and security challenges. ""However, the risk of spread in other provinces and neighboring countries remains present as long as the epidemic remains active,"" it said.

WHO notes various hurdles

In its weekly snapshot of the outbreak, the WHO said today that virus transmission continues with moderate intensity and that Katwa and Butembo are still the main areas of concern, though small clusters continue to pop up across a wide part of the affected area.

For example, it said an emerging cluster in Mandima health zone is occurring in a previously unaffected village, consisting of five epidemiologically linked cases and a sixth involving a person who was probably exposed in Butembo. Also, a probable and confirmed case in Masereka have links to a Butembo transmission chain.

""These events highlight the importance for response teams to remain active across all areas, including those with lower case incidence, to rapidly detect new cases and prevent onward transmission,"" the WHO said.

Though the incidence of new cases is declining, a high proportion of community deaths are among confirmed cases, a low number of new cases are among known contacts, and delays persist in detecting illnesses and isolating patients in ETCs, the agency said.

Mar 7 WHO update","The medical charity Doctors Without Borders has criticised the humanitarian response to the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

It said not enough's been done to gain the trust of local communities, increasingly making aid workers a target of violence.

The comments came as the head of the World Health Organization is visiting the country to get an update on the outbreak.

Al Jazeera's Alexi O'Brien reports.",no result found,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The battle against Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo is failing because ordinary people do not trust health workers and an overly militarized response is alienating patients and families, the medical charity MSF said on Thursday.

FILE PHOTO: A mother of a child, suspected of dying from Ebola, cries outside a hospital during the funeral in Beni, North Kivu Province of Democratic Republic of Congo, December 17, 2018. REUTERS/Goran Tomasevic

Last week Medecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) suspended medical activities at the focal point of the epidemic after two of its facilities were torched by unidentified assailants.

MSF’s international president Joanne Liu said the outbreak, which has killed 569 people, would not be beaten unless the community trusted the authorities and were treated humanely.

“The existing atmosphere can only be described as toxic,” Liu told reporters in Geneva.

Ebola responders were increasingly seen as the enemy, with more than 30 attacks and incidents against the Ebola response in the past month alone, she said.

The epidemic is in a region of Congo that is prey to armed groups and violence where officials are prone to see threats through a security lens and to use force.

“There is a lot of militarization of the Ebola response,” she said. “Using police to force people into complying with health measures is not only unethical, it’s totally counterproductive. The communities are not the enemy.”

Involvement of security and police forces merely deepened suspicions that Ebola was being used as a political tool, she said.

A spokeswoman for Congo’s Health Ministry said there appeared to be confusion about the security forces’ role.

“The police and the army are not involved in Ebola response activities and their role has never been to enforce sanitary measures,” Jessica Ilunga said.

The Interior Ministry has been asked to guarantee security, as it is unacceptable for health officials to be threatened and attacked, or for the threat of violence to stop families burying their loved ones in a dignified and safe manner, she said.

MSF was insisting on security before it returned to its damaged facilities, she said. Local officials, unlike international staffers, did not have the privilege of being evacuated for security reasons, she said.

Liu said there were still signs the outbreak - the second worst ever - was not being brought under control.

Forty percent of deaths were outside medical centers, meaning patients had not sought care, and 35 percent of new patients were not linked to existing cases, meaning the spread of the disease was not being tracked.

“Ebola still has the upper hand,” Liu said.

Villagers saw fleets of cars racing to pick up a single sick person and vast amounts of money pouring in. Some were instructed to wash their hands but had no soap to do so.

“They see their relatives sprayed with chlorine and wrapped in plastic bags, buried without ceremony. Then they see their possessions burned,” she said.

Mar 8 DRC report

Measles, tetanus cases highlight true cost of anti-vaccine movement

Writing in a commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), several public health professionals enumerated the true cost of measles cases in present-day America, suggesting that responding to a single case of measles costs $142,000—among other substantial impacts.

In 2000, the United States eliminated endemic measles, but communities with unvaccinated children, who are largely so because of religious or philosophical reasons, have fueled several recent outbreaks across the country. The authors of the commentary note that, in addition to the financial costs, measles sequelae last for 2 to 3 years post-infection. On a larger scale, outbreaks greatly disrupt public health offices and clinical practices.

""Policy makers must consider the long-term immunologic effects measles infection has on the individual, the complete financial cost associated with outbreak response, and the associated strain on health system infrastructure when resources are diverted at the individual, hospital, and community level,"" the authors conclude.

In another example of the true cost of refusing routine immunizations, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) todaypublished a report on the first tetanus case recorded in Oregon in more than 30 years. The patient was a 6-year-old boy who contracted the bacterial infection in 2017 after suffering a laceration on his forehead. The boy had received no immunizations.

The boy suffered severe symptoms, including jaw clenching, muscles spasms, spasticity, and difficulty breathing, before he needed to be air-lifted to a hospital.

""The boy required 57 days of inpatient acute care, including 47 days in the intensive care unit. The inpatient charges totaled $811,929 (excluding air transportation, inpatient rehabilitation, and ambulatory follow-up costs),"" the authors said. ""Despite extensive review of the risks and benefits of tetanus vaccination by physicians, the family declined the second dose of DTaP and any other recommended immunizations.""

Autism, depression risk rises in kids after moms infected in pregnancy

An observational study of nearly 1.8 million Swedish children born from 1973 to 2014 found an increased risk of autism and depression in children born to women who had an infection during hospitalization during pregnancy. An international research team based at the University of Gothenburg reported its findings this week in JAMA Psychiatry.

For the study, the investigators looked at data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, linking it to the national inpatient register, which included information on whether the mother had an infection diagnosis during hospitalization while pregnant. The researchers monitored children's mental health status until 2014.

The team saw a marked rise in a child's hospitalization in later life for autism or depression if his or her mother had an infection diagnosis during pregnancy. The risk increase was 79% for autism and 24% for depression. The researchers found an increased risk even after mild infection diagnosed in the pregnant mother during hospitalization for conditions other than infection.

They didn't, however, find an association between to other psychiatric diagnoses, bipolar disorder and psychosis, including schizophrenia.

The observational nature of the study doesn't yield any clues about a possible mechanism, but the authors wrote that others have found the inflammatory reaction in the mother may produce inflammatory proteins that could alter gene expression in fetal brain cells. They note that other research suggests maternal inflammation increases the production of serotonin in the placenta, which might affect the baby's brain development.

Verena Sengpiel, MD, study coauthor and associate professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Gothenburg, said in a press release from the school, ""The results indicate that safeguarding against and preventing infection during pregnancy as far as possible by, for instance, following flu vaccination recommendations, may be called for.""

Nigeria records first vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 infection of year

Nigeria has recorded its first case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2 ) in 2019, according to the latest update today from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). This is the first case of vaccine-derived polio noted globally in 2019.

The case-patient is from Kwara state and experienced onset of paralysis on Jan 22.

Last year, Nigeria recorded 34 cases of cVDPV2 in two separate and ongoing outbreaks in Jigawa and Sokoto states. According to GPEI, no cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been reported in Nigeria since 2016.

Nigeria, along with Afghanistan and Pakistan, is one of three remaining countries with endemic polio transmission. So far in 2019, Afghanistan has recorded two cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) infection, and Pakistan has recorded four cases of WPV1.

Mar 8 GPEI report",no result found,no result found,no result found,"An Ebola treatment center in Katwa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, that was attacked and destroyed on Feb. 24.

The international president of Doctors Without Borders issued a scathing analysis on Thursday of the efforts to control the 7-month-old Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, saying the community hostility that is undermining the work is the fault of the response, not the people in the region.

And Dr. Joanne Liu, who was in the affected area of DRC last week when two MSF-run Ebola treatment centers were destroyed by fire, said continuing the current approach — with ramped-up security — is unlikely to end the outbreak, which is already the second largest on record. (The organization’s acronym is based on the group’s name in French.)

“We’re not sure that if we keep doing what we’re doing [it] will lead us to the end of things,” Liu said in a press conference in Geneva, where MSF is based.

Relying more heavily on security backup from local police, the Congolese Army, or United Nations peacekeepers in the region is increasing the perception that the Ebola response workers are “the enemy,” Liu warned.

“The use of coercion adds fuel to this. Using police to force people into complying with health measures is not only unethical, it’s totally counterproductive,” she said. “The communities are not the enemy. Ebola is the common enemy.”

MSF pulled its staff from Butembo and Katwa last week after the attacks on the treatment centers. The two cities are in the southern part of the outbreak zone, and are where most of the Ebola cases are now being found.

The organization is still staffing Ebola operations in other parts of North Kivu and Ituri, the affected provinces. MSF is in discussions about whether it will return to Katwa and Butembo, though Liu said the organization needs to discern first whether those communities want the MSF staff to return.

Katwa and Butembo have seen 344 Ebola cases to date, more than a third of the outbreak total. So far there have been more than 907 cases in this outbreak, with 569 deaths.

Those cities are where the hostility to the response workers has been greatest. Liu said in the past month there have been at least 30 attacks on response workers and facilities.

She noted that at this point in the outbreak, 40 percent of confirmed cases are still dying in the community, having shunned Ebola treatment centers.

And in Katwa and Butembo in the past three weeks, 43 percent of new cases aren’t part of known chains of transmission, which means no one knows how they have become infected, she added.

Those are markers that the help being offered by the Ebola response isn’t what people feel they need, Liu said. She called the atmosphere towards the response “toxic.”

The difficulty in controlling the outbreak is ironic, she noted, because there are tools being used that people who worked on earlier Ebola outbreaks only dreamed of — experimental drugs and vaccine. “We were craving for vaccine” during the West African outbreak of 2014-2016, Liu said.

One problem, she said, is the fact that the vaccine is being used in a ring vaccination approach, offered only to frontline workers and people who are known to have been in the virus’s path — known contacts of cases and contacts of the contacts.

Supplies of the vaccine, being developed by Merck, are limited, and it takes about a year to make new batches. So the World Health Organization, which is overseeing the vaccination program, is being cautious with its use. To date, nearly 86,000 people have been vaccinated in this outbreak.

Liu said people living in the outbreak zone do not understand why only certain people can be vaccinated. She argued using some of the other experimental vaccines — there are several, though they are not as far along in the testing process as the Merck one — would help.

She also advocated tailoring the response to the needs of the people, saying many don’t want to be sent to treatment centers where health care workers are unrecognizable under layers of protective gear. “It means treating patients as humans, and not biothreats,” Liu said.

There should be options for training people in the community in how to safely care for Ebola patients at home if they are adamantly opposed to going to a treatment center, she argued. Likewise, people living in communities that Ebola response teams cannot easily reach because of security concerns could be trained on how to safely care for their sick, she said."

The latest attack came on the same day Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), was due to visit the centre.

It was not immediately clear if the visit at the facility, which is managed by the DRC's health ministry in collaboration with WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), would still happen.

'Toxic' atmosphere

Ebola, a deadly viral disease, broke out in North Kivu in August last year, before spreading to neighbouring Ituri province. Both provinces are wracked by intercommunal violence and unrest.

According to the latest ministry figures, the DRC's current and worst Ebola outbreak has killed close to 600 people.

170620124859533

Efforts to contain the epidemic, the 10th documented in the country, have been hampered by poor security in the highly unstable region, where numerous militia groups are active.

On Thursday, a leading medical charity warned that efforts to tackle the outbreak were falling short, accusing the DRC's authorities of failing to contain it because of an overly militarised response that was alienating patients and their families and contributing to the creation of a ""toxic"" atmosphere.

Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF, highlighted that more than 40 percent of deaths were occurring in communities rather than in Ebola treatment centres.

The charity alleged that security forces had used ""coercion"" while overseeing safe burials, tracking contacts and assisting with the admission of patients to treatment centres.

But Jessica Ilunga, a spokeswoman for the DRC's health ministry, rejected MSF's claims as a ""gross exaggeration of the situation"" and said there was a ""misunderstanding"" about the security forces' role in dealing with the outbreak.

""The police and the army are not involved in Ebola-response activities, and their role has never been to enforce sanitary measures,"" Ilunga said.

""Contrary to international agents, local health workers don't have the privilege of being evacuated when security conditions worsen. As such, it is necessary to reinforce the security to allow for smooth response operations,"" she added.",no result found,"GOMA, Congo (Reuters) - Mai Mai militiamen attacked an Ebola treatment center at the heart of an outbreak of the disease in eastern Congo on Saturday, killing a policeman and wounding health workers before being repelled by security forces.

The center in Butembo was the same one torched by unknown assailants last week, an attack that prompted medical aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres to suspend activities in the area.

Aid workers have faced deep mistrust in some areas as they work to contain the outbreak of the deadly hemorrhagic fever, the worst in Democratic Republic of Congo’s history, killing close to 600 people so far.

Efforts to contain the virus have been hampered by a plethora of armed groups operating in Congo’s lawless east.

World Health Organisation (WHO) President Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited the Butembo center later on Saturday, a statement from the organization said.

“It breaks my heart to think of the health workers injured and the police officer who died in today’s attack, as we continue to mourn those who died in previous attacks, while defending the right to health,” Tedros was quoted as saying.

“But we have no choice except to continue serving the people here, who are among the most vulnerable in the world.”

Butembo major Sylvain Kanyamanda Mbusa said the Mai Mai militants had been successfully beaten back.

“Because of previous attacks, a security system was already in place and attackers were quickly confronted by the police officers guarding the ...center,” he told Reuters.

The facility had resumed operations only a week ago and had been managed by the ministry of health in collaboration with the WHO and United Nations children’s agency.

The Mai Mai take their name from the word for “water” in a local Swahili dialect, because some of their fighters believe magic can turn flying bullets into water.

They comprise several armed bands that originally formed to resist two invasions by Rwandan forces in the late 1990s. They have since morphed into a variety of ethnic-based militia, smuggling networks and protection rackets.

One of the militiamen was wounded in Saturday’s attack and is in custody, Kanyamanda Mbusa said.

Alongside the fresh violence, the DRC health ministry reported five new cases in updates over the weekend and through today, and an outbreak response team made headway tracking a transmission chain in a high-risk village south of Butembo.

Latest attack precedes high-level visit

The health ministry said in its Mar 9 update that early that morning, heavily armed men attempted to attack the Butembo's Ebola treatment center. But officials had been informed of a possible attack and security forces had prepositioned themselves around the treatment center, which helped repel the attackers and save lives.

Officials said a policeman protecting the treatment center died in the gun battle and that several assailants were captured.

The health ministry was in contact with medical staff, who were on hand to calm patients who remained in their isolation rooms.

Attackers included Mai Mai militia, and the attack also wounded health workers, according to a Mar 9 report from Reuters. North Kivu is one of the DRC provinces that is home to different Mai Mai militia groups, which reportedly align themselves with a variety of domestic, foreign, and guerilla groups with different objectives, some political.

The treatment center was attacked by an unknown group on Feb 27, which—along with an earlier attack an another facility in Katwa—prompted Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to withdraw its staff from the outbreak's epicenter. The Butembo location quickly reopened, staffed by local health workers.

Saturday's attack came just hours before a visit from World Health Organization (WHO) leadership, accompanied by senior US officials. During a 3-day mission, the group met with the DRC's president, government officials, partner organizations, and local responders.

More protection requested

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said in a statement, ""It breaks my heart to think of the health workers injured and police officer who died in today's attack, as we continue to mourn those who died in previous attacks, while defending the right to health. But we have no choice except to continue serving the people here, who are among the most vulnerable in the world.""

Tedros said the attacks aren't by the community; they are perpetrated on the community by groups exploiting a desperate situation for their own purposes. He said people in Ebola-hit communities want and deserve a place to receive care and a chance to survive the disease. ""They do not deserve to suffer in their homes while infecting their loved ones; they do not deserve to suffer in inadequately resourced health centers while infecting health workers.""

He said the WHO has asked for and received more support from the United Nations and local police to protect the treatment centers, and he emphasized that battling Ebola requires striking a delicate balance between providing accessible care, maintaining the neutrality of the response, and protecting patients and staff from attacks by armed groups.

""These are the dilemmas we face in conflict zones around the world. We are committed to ending the outbreak, and we are committed to improving the health of the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,"" Tedros said.

MSF on its Twitter account strongly condemned what it called an appalling attack on the Ebola treatment center in Butembo. It also expressed its solidarity with colleagues from the health ministry and the WHO, and it sent condolences to the family of the police officer who died during the attack.

Five new cases, 4 more deaths

In other outbreak developments, in daily updates over the weekend and through today, the health ministry reported 5 more cases, including 3 in Butembo, 1 in Katwa, and 1 in Biena.

The new cases raise the outbreak total to 923, which includes 858 confirmed and 65 probable cases. Health officials are still investigating 191 suspected cases.

Four more people died from their infections, all from Butembo, boosting the fatality count to 582. One death occurred in the community, and three patients died in the city's Ebola treatment center.

Team follows virus to high-risk village

It today's update, the DRC health ministry said health officials from the Butembo outbreak response office today made a risky mission to a village named Kighali in Lubero health zone, located south of Butembo. It said the trek is dangerous, because armed groups monitor the movement of vehicles and people from hills surrounding the village.

Yesterday, three epidemiologists who entered the village to investigate a confirmed case there in a woman who fled Butembo were seriously injured by an angry mob.

Today's mission was designed to address community reluctance against vaccination and household decontamination and to pave the way for other response steps, including contact tracing, establishing a 21-day tracking system, and distributing food to all contacts.

The health ministry said local leaders, including the priest, territory administrator, and health zone chief medical officer, helped outbreak coordinator Jean-Christophe Shako engage with the local population.

It said a large crowd gathered to listen to speeches from the speakers, who emphasized the importance of hosting response teams, being vaccinated, and respecting other prevention steps. So far, about 60 contacts there have registered for vaccination and 21-day follow up.

With the latest report, cases have reach 925, of which 860 are confirmed and 65 are probable. In total, there have been 584 deaths, and 170 suspected cases are still under investigation.

'Constant disruption' slowing response

Today the World Health Organization's (WHO's) African regional office also released its latest update on the outbreak. It includes three reports of violent encounters slowing vaccination campaigns in Katwa, Butembo, and Kalunguta.

""In Kalunguta the vaccination team was temporarily held by an armed group, and vaccination teams in the Kivika area, Katwa were subjected to aggression, with destruction of chairs, tables and tents; vaccination sites in Butembo were also inaccessible due to insecurity,"" the WHO said.

Despite these setbacks, the ring vaccination campaign with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV continues. As of yesterday, a total of 87,390 people have been vaccinated, DRC health officials said, including 22,191 in Katwa, 20,829 in Beni, 10,908 in Butembo, and 6,109 in Mabalako.

""The Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo continues with moderate transmission intensity. Continuing insecurity, with response teams coming under attack are a very real concern,"" the WHO said. ""Quite apart from the danger to personnel, this constant disruption interrupts response activities and increases the risk that chains of transmission will be missed or not followed-up.""

Katwa still major hot spot

Katwa remains the major hot spot in the DRC, the WHO said, with 56% of new cases recorded in the past 21 days originating in that town. Though 20 health zones have reported cases in the outbreak, Katwa, Butembo, Mandima, Masereka, Kyondo and Lubero health zones have all reported cases within the last week.

One of the recent cases in Mandima involved a healthcare worker, bringing the total number of health workers infected in this outbreak to 73, including 25 deaths.

Two cases in lesser hot spots

The two latest cases were reported in Mandima in Ituri province, which has reported a handful of recent cases, and from Kalunguta in North Kivu province, an insecure area where vaccination teams were recently held by an armed group.

The cases lift the outbreak total to 927, which includes 862 confirmed and 65 probable cases. No new deaths were reported, keeping the fatality count at 584.

Meanwhile, the number of people vaccinated continued to rise, with 87,668 people immunized. Nearly a fourth of them have been in Katwa, one of the current main hot spots.

Seroprevalence in central Africa

For the study, an international team of researchers, hoping to get a better handle on serologic prevalence of Ebola and the geographic range of hemorrhagic fever viruses, tested 2,430 blood samples that had been collected from 1997 to 2012 for other studies.

The countries are the Republic of Congo, the DRC, Uganda, Ghana, and Cameroon. The team published its findings yesterday in Emerging Infectious Diseases.

The experts screened the samples for antibodies using a microneutralization assay and a new luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay. Samples that were positive for Ebola antibodies were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

For the Republic of Congo and the DRC—both of which have reported Ebola outbreaks—serologic prevalence was 2% to 3.5%, generally consistent with earlier studies. Higher prevalence rates were seen in samples from rural areas compared with urban areas.

They also found a 1.3% prevalence in southern Cameroon, an area thought to be at risk for the spread of Marburg virus, another viral hemorrhagic fever pathogen. The country hasn't reported any Ebola cases, and the authors said the findings suggests a low risk of exposure. An 1983 serologic survey for different parts of the country had found a 3% to 14.5% seroprevalence.

Taken together, the team said evidence of past Ebola exposure in different parts of central Africa might be explained by migration of people from known exposure areas or where the virus hasn't been detected yet. The authors added that some areas might be at increased risk of human exposure because of Ebola or related viruses, owing to environmental, societal, and behavioral practices.

14-Mar-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The public health response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak continues to make gains. During the last 21 days (20 February – 12 March 2019), no new cases have been detected in 10 of the 20 health zones that have been affected during the outbreak (Figure 1). There has also been fewer new cases observed over the past five weeks compared to January 2019 and earlier in the outbreak (Figure 2).

Currently, the greatest concern centres on the neighbouring urban areas of Katwa and Butembo, which continue to contribute about three-quarters of recent cases. Clusters in other areas of North Kivu and Ituri provinces have been linked to chains of transmission in Katwa and Butembo, and have thus far been contained to limited local transmissions with relatively small numbers of cases. A total of 74 confirmed cases were reported during the last 21 days from 32 of the 125 health areas affected to date (Table 1). Risk of further chains of transmission and spread remain high, as highlighted by the recent spread to Lubero Health Zone, and reintroduction to Biena Health Zone following a prolonged period without new cases.

Response teams are fully operational in all outbreak affected areas and there are encouraging improvements in community acceptance of the response, despite the challenges of ongoing insecurity caused by armed groups. For example, during the last 21 days in Katwa and Butembo, 88% of the 256 families with a family member who died and was suspected to have EVD, accepted the support from response teams to conduct a safe and dignified burial. Seventy-four new vaccination rings were launched, with over 90% of people eligible for vaccination accepting to do so, and over 90% of these participated in follow-up visits. A total of 5974 people (including 2159 health and frontline workers) consented and were vaccinated this period; overall 87,632 people have been vaccinated to date. Vaccination teams are continuing to follow-up on 12 rings wherein the families have not yet accepted the intervention, and two other rings that are in the process of being defined. Seven field laboratories have remained fully operational, sustaining similar testing rates as previous weeks. During the past week, 1213 samples from new suspected cases, community deaths and previously confirmed cases were tested within 48 hours. Outreach teams made up mostly of local volunteers also met with 6000 households during the past week, building local knowledge of Ebola, and referring sick individuals to either Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) or other health facilities as appropriate. In the last two weeks, community dialogues were held in several villages in Katwa and Vuhovi to find ways in engaging community members to build trust and ownership in the Ebola response.

Efforts to strengthen case finding and investigation, and contact tracing activities are also bearing fruit. Of 74 confirmed cases reported in the last 21 days, 83% (62 cases) have been epidemiologically linked to active chains of transmission; either listed as contacts at illness onset (47 cases) or linked retrospectively to other cases or health centre where they were likely exposed (15 cases). Investigations are ongoing to identify links for the remaining cases.

Challenges include further attacks by armed groups on affected communities and ETCs, elements of community mistrust, and persistent delays in getting people into care in ETCs for various reasons. The Ministry of Health, WHO and partners continue to work actively to build community trust and participation in the response, while reinforcing security measures to protect patients and response teams. The ETC in Butembo has been rebuilt following two attacks and is treating patients again, and the Katwa Transit Centre remains operational.

Since the beginning of the outbreak to 12 March 2019, 927 EVD cases1 (862 confirmed and 65 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (525) were female and 30% (280) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 125 of 319 health areas across 20 health zones of the North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1). Overall, 584 deaths (case fatality ratio: 63%) have been reported, and 308 patients have been discharged from ETCs.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The latest assessment on 6 March 2019 concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. The outbreak has continued with a similar epidemiological profile to the last assessment. Attacks on ETCs in Katwa and Butembo represented the first large-scale and organized attacks targeted directly at the Ebola response, and were of a different order of magnitude to episodes of mistrust in communities or dangers of being caught in crossfire between fighting parties. In addition, the persistence of pockets of community resistance and mistrust, exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas; reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. These events occur amidst declining trends in case incidence; however, the high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, collectively increase the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increased risk of geographical spread within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. As do the risk of increased population movement anticipated during periods of heightened insecurity.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Tedros, who goes by his first name, said, ""We will stay and work with communities and government to stay and provide services for all health needs. This is what the community is asking for.""

The press conference came on the heels of Tedros's visit to the DRC last week with Robert Redfield, MD the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It also comes on a day DRC officials added 5 new cases to the outbreak total and reported new acts of violence.

Community acceptance amid violence

At the start of the visit, Tedros said he spoke with health workers in Butembo who were targeted by violence. Their commitment to staying and fighting the outbreak gave him hope that the people on the ground in the DRC will be able to end the outbreak, and he confirmed that security is the number one challenge facing health workers in the DRC.

Throughout the press conference, Tedros said the acts of violence and resistance are not coming from the community, but rather are being inflicted upon the community by rebel forces, including the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and Mai Mai.

""We see more community cooperation and increasing acceptance,"" Tedros said; ""87% of families agree to safe and dignified burials, and over 90% of people have accepted vaccination.""

What the community has asked of the WHO, Tedros said, is support in building a health system after Ebola transmission ends. He pledged as much, saying, ""Leaving the area is not an option, evacuation is not an option"" for the WHO.

Half as many cases as in January

In contrast to recent remarks from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) International President Joanne Liu, MD, who said the strategies being used in the DRC were not adequate to end the outbreak, Tedros described signs the virus was on the retreat in DRC.

""There's half as many new cases per week now as there were in January,"" he said. January saw an average of 50 cases per week, which is now down to 25 cases per week.

Additionally, Tedros said the outbreak has been contained in 11 of 28 communities that have reported Ebola.

Five more cases, new attack

Today the DRC's ministry of health recorded five new Ebola cases, three in Mandima and one each in Kalunguta and Lubero. Three deaths were also recorded, including a community death in Mandima.

The cases bring the outbreak totals to 932, including 587 deaths. A total of 210 suspected cases are under investigation.

Also today, both the DRC and Tedros mentioned a new attack in Biena. A mob attacked Biena's General Reference Hospital and a local transit center, and all outbreak activities are stopped for at least today, the DRC said.

Finally the DRC updated its vaccination campaign totals: 87,985 people have been vaccinated since August with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV, including 22,336 in Katwa, 20,849 in Beni, and 10,939 in Butembo.

The outbreak, the second worst in history, is believed to have killed 587 people in a region beset by violence and poverty. A rapid international response has so far stopped the disease spreading into neighboring countries.

“We have averted a much larger outbreak,” WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus Adhanom told a news conference, adding that the affected area was contained and shrinking.

“Our target now is to finish it within the next six months.”

The number of new cases has halved to 25 per week since January, and the virus was now concentrated in Butembo and Katwa. However, community distrust and attacks by armed groups were hampering the response.

On Thursday, a group of young men attacked an Ebola center for the fifth time since last month, Congo’s health ministry said, after medics attempted to collect samples from the body of a man suspected of having died of the virus.

Police opened fire to disperse the crowd in the Biena health zone, west of Butembo, killing one person and injuring another, the ministry said in a statement.

Last week the head of medical charity MSF, which had two facilities attacked, said the battle against Ebola was being lost because ordinary people did not trust health workers and the response was overly militarized.

Tedros, who has just returned from the outbreak zone, said local people were despairing and rightly wondered why the world was so exercised by Ebola while caring so little about other problems, including cholera and malaria.

“I’d actually like to call upon the international community to link the outbreak control now with developing the health system,” he said.

“That’s a big challenge. Otherwise we will appear as if we are preventing Ebola getting into other countries and we don’t care about the demands of the community.”

He said the WHO would not leave when the outbreak ended, but would help the government to build stronger health services.

He called on international donors to fund the $148 million plan to tackle Ebola in the next six months, a tiny spend compared to the potential cost. The worst outbreak, which killed 11,300 people in West Africa in 2013-2016, cost an estimated $53 billion, according to one study.",no result found

In other developments, a new survey conducted among residents of the DRC's Ebola-hit region found that the vaccine was well tolerated and had high acceptability .

Four new cases, 4 more deaths

The four new cases are in Mandima, Katwa, Butembo, and Kayina. Also, 240 suspected illnesses are under investigation. The new cases push the outbreak total to 936 cases, which includes 871 confirmed and 65 probable infections.

Four more people died from their infections, including two in community settings in Mandima and Butembo, an occurrence known to raise the transmission risk. Two of the deaths occurred in Ebola treatment centers, one in Mabalako and one in Beni.

Since the outbreak began, 591 people have died from Ebola.

Some vaccine resistance noted

In the vaccine survey, researchers from the DRC and Canada administered a 34-item questionnaire to a convenience sample of 96 people in Mangina, where the outbreak began, and Butembo. They reported their findings Mar 13 in Vaccine.

The study included 90 people who received the VSV-EBOV vaccine and 96 controls who weren't eligible to be vaccinated.

The survey took place from Sep 7 to Sep 10 of 2018. The questions, modeled after earlier studies in Ebola outbreak countries, asked people about their perceptions of the disease and their impressions of response efforts, such as vaccination and safe burials. Regarding the vaccine component, respondents were asked about side effects and if they would recommend immunization to a friend or family member.

Side effects were reported by 83% of vaccine recipients, but only five (7%) reported joint pain and four (5%) reported rash. The researchers noted that although side effects were commonly reported, the rate they saw in the survey was lower than that of an earlier clinical study involving healthy volunteers.

Of the people vaccinated, 84% were classified as ""promoters,"" meaning they would recommend it to others. And of the unvaccinated controls, 72% said they'd want to be vaccinated if supply was available. Of both groups combined, 82% said the vaccine was acceptable for family members.

When they looked at people who had negative attitudes about the vaccine, researchers found an association between lower Ebola knowledge, resistance toward Ebola control measures, and negative vaccine attitudes among some people who hadn't received the vaccine.

""This finding may signal the presence of a significant sub-group of people in Eastern DRC demonstrating social resistance to EVD control efforts that require special attention, consistent with numerous media reports,"" the investigators wrote.

Community mistrust has been a feature of past Ebola outbreaks and, along with insecurity, has been a steep challenge in the current outbreak. In a related development, the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation recently announced an Ebola response accelerator challenge to identify innovative solutions to address both insecurity and community mistrust.

The challenge closes Mar 25, and the group expects to review proposals and make decisions in early April.

Mar 13 Vaccine abstract

Paul G. Allen Foundation Ebola challenge information",no result found,no result found,no result found,"Health workers are seen through a bullet hole left in the window of an Ebola treatment center that was attacked in Butembo.

The director-general of the World Health Organization said Thursday that health officials are making progress against the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and that the footprint of the outbreak zone is actually contracting.

The cautiously hopeful remarks from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who visited the outbreak zone last week, came just hours after the most recent attack on an Ebola treatment center, one in a series that has plagued efforts to bring this outbreak, now in its eighth month, to an end.

As of Wednesday, there have been 927 cases in the outbreak and 584 deaths, making this the second largest Ebola outbreak on record. But Tedros, as he is known, said he is convinced the Congolese government and the international partners working on the response will get the job done.

“Their dedication is unparalleled,” he said during a Geneva press conference. “The global community must stay the course.”

His optimism is not universally shared. Dr. Joanne Liu, international president of the medical group Doctors Without Borders, criticized the Ebola response efforts last week, insisting that the current approach was failing to bring the outbreak under control. The group withdrew its staff from two cities in the DRC, deeming it too dangerous to stay, after attacks last month on Ebola treatment centers that Liu’s organization was operating.

“We’re not sure that if we keep doing what we’re doing [it] will lead us to the end of things,” Liu said during a press conference.

Tedros did not mention Liu by name, but he did object to suggestions that the outbreak response is failing. He noted the average weekly case count has dropped from 50 in January to 25.

The virus has not as yet spread to other parts of the Congo or to neighboring countries, which have prepared for that possibility by vaccinating health workers at facilities near the border they share with DRC. And within the outbreak zone, transmission has been contained in a number of locations, Tedros said, with Butembo and Katwa remaining as active hot spots.

The latest Ebola facility to be burned, on Thursday, was a transit center located in Biena. Transit centers are facilities where people suspected of having Ebola wait for their test results.

The director-general said the outbreak response has to strike a delicate balance, protecting its workers but also working to gain the trust of the community. The violence directed at the Ebola response facilities are actually attacks on the affected communities, Tedros said. He described the attackers as people who only know violence.

“They don’t understand the language of political settlement or negotiation,” said Tedros. “The only language they know is just shooting.”

The WHO has projected it will take several more months at least to stop this outbreak. In the meantime, it has become harder to raise money for the effort. Of the estimated $148 million needed for the first six months of 2019, only $31 million has come in and another $58 million has been pledged. That leaves a gap of nearly $60 million, the director-general said.

There is no option but to stop the virus, he warned.

“To be honest, leaving the area is not an option. Evacuation is not an option,” Tedros said. “We will lose what we have gained so far. And not only that, the virus will get a free ride to spread aggressively.”"

Controlling the difficult and dangerous Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo may take another year or more, Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned Friday.

That projection is bleaker than one issued Thursday by the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who said he hoped the epidemic could be stopped within the next six months.

But Redfield, who traveled to the Congo with the WHO director-general last week, said it would be a mistake not to plan for a more prolonged outbreak, given the evident complexity of stopping transmission of the virus in northeastern DRC.

“We cannot underestimate this outbreak. We need a long-term strategy,” Redfield told STAT.

“I would love to see this outbreak end in six months, like my friend Tedros continues to hope for. But I think the reality, the practical reality, is this is going to be a longer road. And we need to start planning for it,” he said.

That could prove challenging from a funding point of view. The WHO and other United Nations agencies involved in the outbreak are already struggling to raise the money needed to finance the response through July of this year.

Agencies and nongovernmental organizations working to stop the virus have estimated their efforts will cost $148 million — but have only been able to raise about 60 percent of that amount, Tedros said.

The epidemic, which may date back to late April of last year, was only recognized as an Ebola outbreak in late July. As of Thursday, there have been 932 cases and 587 deaths, making it the second largest Ebola outbreak on record.

In the months since the outbreak was declared, the Ebola response workers have faced extremely taxing conditions. Those include attacks on workers trying to trace and vaccinate people who have been in contact with known cases and on those attempting to ensure the corpses of Ebola cases are being buried safely.

In the past few weeks, Ebola treatment centers have also come under attack. Centers at Butembo and Katwa — side-by-side cities where most of the cases are now occurring — were partially destroyed by fire. The Butembo treatment center has been repaired and reopened, but came under renewed attack last Saturday, hours before Redfield and Tedros, as the WHO leader is known, arrived to tour it.

Redfield said he and the WHO director-general visited the outbreak zone to recalibrate the response. More efforts, he said, must be placed on gaining the community’s trust so that they will engage with outbreak response teams.

“We have not effectively engaged the community as a part of the response. Figuring out how to do that is critical,” Redfield said.

So is improving the skill sets of the people working on the response — a task CDC will contribute to, Redfield said.

The outbreak is occurring in a part of the Congo that has been enmeshed in conflict for decades. The insecurity prompted the State Department to order U.S. government employees out of the area last August; they have not been allowed to return to help with the response since.

Still, the CDC has had staff working on the outbreak in other locations — in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, at WHO headquarters in Geneva and in neighboring countries where they’ve helped authorities prepare to deal with imported Ebola cases, if they should arise.

Redfield said the CDC currently has three people in Goma, a major city south of the outbreak zone where the outbreak response is being relocated. He said he hopes to get clearance to expand the CDC’s presence there, if the security situation allows for it."

Since Saturday, 8 new cases were reported in Katwa, 6 in Vuhovi, and 5 in Masereka. Butembo, Kyondo, and Kalunguta also reported cases. Twelve new deaths were reported, including eight community deaths.

The new cases bring the outbreak total to 960 cases, including 603 deaths. A total of 172 suspected cases are still under investigation.

As of today, 89,173 people have been vaccinated with Merck's VSV-EBOV, including 22,470 in Katwa, 20,956 in Beni, and 10,972 in Butembo.

Family cluster in Vuhovi refused vaccination

On Saturday, health officials in the DRC said the cases in Vuhovi likely came from a single family who refused follow-up care and vaccination after a family member contracted the virus.

""Following the last community death in this family, several neighbors and other villagers moved and asked to be vaccinated,"" health officials said, also noting that eventually the family members were treated at an Ebola treatment center.

The cases from Masereka are also family members of a confirmed patient who died on Mar 4.

More violence reported against response

Also late last week brought the fourth violent attack on response workers in the last month, this time in Biena.

According to media reports, the attack took place after health workers tried to take a blood samples from a deceased man who they suspected had Ebola. A group of young people attacked the workers, and police had to shoot at a crowd, killing one person.

Last week, in a press conference concerning the outbreak--now in its eighth month--World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said local violence is the most detrimental factor to response efforts.

In other outbreak developments, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office in a weekly report today noted two more infections in health workers, and though Katwa is still the hot spot, seven health zones that have reported recent cases are points of concern.

New cases, more community deaths

Of the eight new cases the DRC health ministry reported today, four are in Masereka—the site of a recent family cluster—and two are in Katwa. Also, Kayina and Mandima each have one new case.

The illnesses lift the overall outbreak total to 968 cases, which includes 903 confirmed and 65 probable infections. Health officials are still investigating 234 suspected cases.

Three more people died from Ebola, including two in community settings—one in Katwa and one in Mandima. The other fatality occurred at Butembo's Ebola treatment center. The developments increase the overall number of deaths to 606.

Concerns about 7 health zones

In its weekly diseases and health emergencies update, the WHO's African regional office said though Katwa health zone is still the main epicenter, responsible for 44% of cases over the past 3 weeks, seven health zones have reported new confirmed cases over the past 3 days and remain a concern. Besides Katwa they include Masereka, Vuhovi, Butembo, Kyondo, Mandima, and Kayina.

According to the report, two more infections have been reported in healthcare workers, bringing the total to 77, of which 26 were fatal.

In other recent developments, outbreak responders have established a unit to coordinate monitoring and analysis of lost contacts in Bunia in Ituri province.

Also, the report had more details about recent violence in Biena in North Kivu province, where health workers trying to obtain blood samples from a deceased man with suspected Ebola were attacked, prompting a police response. The WHO report says a transit center in Mambowa, where suspected patients await test results, was attacked.

In summarizing the latest trends, the WHO said the outbreak continues with moderate intensity and though the absolute numbers appear to be declining, reappearance of the virus in areas where transmission seemed to have stopped is a serious concern. It added that frequent disruptions from community resistance and loss of contacts to follow-up are driving transmission, but the result of proven and innovative health measures in many areas is promising.

""Response efforts need to continue, and funding gaps need to be filled by the global donor community,"" the WHO said.

The cases bring the outbreak's total to 980 cases, including 606 deaths.

The new cases have brought to an end the downward trend mentioned last week in a press conference held by World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD. In mid-March, DRC officials were seeing 25 cases per week, half the number of cases seen in mid-January.

But in the past 5 days, the DRC has recorded 44 cases and several community deaths, which increase the probability of the virus spreading among family members and close contacts.

On Twitter, WHO director of the health emergencies program Mike Ryan. MD, said the increase is likely due, in part, to the security challenges. After violence on Mar 14 in Biena, outbreak response and disease surveillance activities were once again halted.

UNICEF notes decline in pediatric cases

A new situation report published by the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) shows some positive developments in the outbreak.

Only 7 of 21 affected health zones have reported cases in the past 21 days, which shows that the disease is limited geographically and has remained contained in the DRC.

Most encouragingly, cases among children—especially those under the age of 5—are dropping.

""While children and women used to be disproportionately affected by the outbreak, the representation of EVD-infected women, men, and children has become more balanced in the past two months,"" UNICEF said.

In January, half of all new pediatric cases were in children under 5, but that percentage is now 15%. The percentage of cases in women has also dropped, from 62% in December, to 54% in March.

The drop in infections in women and children may coincide with the epicenter of the outbreak moving from Beni to Katwa and Butembo.

UNICEF also said a knowledge, attitudes, and practices study and socio-anthropological survey conducted in Kyondo, Masereka and Musienene health zones in the first week of March showed that only 22 of participants in Kyondo and 26% in Musienene knew Ebola prevention methods.

The gap between community members and outbreak workers was the focus of statements made today by Elhadj As Sy, the secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) after a 3 day visit to the DRC.

""Communities are key to ending Ebola,"" he said. ""Only with their engagement and active participation will we be able to stop this outbreak. Fear, resistance and even denial are often encountered when people are overwhelmed by shocks, hazards and epidemics; but they can be overcome building on community norms, values and social capital.""

Mar 20 IFRC news release",no result found,no result found,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Health authorities in Democratic Republic of Congo have confirmed a case of Ebola in another city of close to 1 million people, the health ministry said on Wednesday.

Bunia is the second-largest city in eastern Congo to confirm a case of the haemorrhagic fever during the current outbreak, which was declared last August and is believed to have killed 610 people and infected 370 more to date.

The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week that the outbreak was concentrated in two areas and could be stopped by September, but poor security in Congo’s militia-ravaged east and community resistance to health workers continue to hamper the response.

The confirmed case in Bunia is a six-month-old infant, whose parents appear to be well, Congo’s health ministry said in a daily bulletin. Investigations are underway to identify how the child was infected, it added.

The cities of Butembo, which has a slightly larger population than Bunia, and Beni, which is slightly smaller, have also experienced Ebola cases.

The current outbreak is the second-deadliest in history behind the 2013-16 epidemic in West Africa that is believed to have killed more than 11,000 people.

21-Mar-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces has recently shown an increase in the number of cases reported by week, after many weeks of overall decline (Figure 1). This rise is not unexpected and, in part, likely a result of the increased security challenges, including the recent direct attacks on treatment centers, and pockets of community mistrust, which slowed some response activities in affected areas for a few days.

Katwa, Butembo, Masereka and Mandima account for over 80% of all cases in the last 21 days. A total of 97 confirmed cases were reported during the last 21 days from 38 of the 130 health areas affected to date (Table 1, Figure 2). This week, EVD was confirmed in an infant who died in Bunia Health Zone, but whose parents are in good health. This is the first confirmed case from this health zone; a previous case was identified from neighbouring Rwampara Health Zone in early February. While investigations are ongoing to determine the source of the infection, teams in place have rapidly implemented response activities including contact tracing, vaccination and heightened surveillance. Given the geographical spread of the epidemic and the high mobility in this region, the risk of Ebola spreading to unaffected areas or being reintroduced to previously affected areas remains high.

Response teams are fully operational in all outbreak affected areas. There are encouraging improvements in community acceptance of the response, despite the ongoing challenges of insecurity caused by armed groups. Over 90% of people eligible for vaccination have accepted to do so, and over 90% of these individuals having participated in follow-up visits. To date, 89 855 people have been vaccinated. Vaccination teams are continuing to follow-up on the rings where some families have not yet accepted the intervention.

Field laboratories have sustained similar testing rates as previous weeks. On average, 1300 samples are tested weekly and more than 23 000 samples have been tested to date with a turnaround time of less than 48 hours. Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) and Transit Centres continue to operate, and the Katwa Transit Centre is being scaled up by ALIMA to increase capacity to respond to the outbreak in that area. To date, 335 patients have received one of the four investigational therapeutics under the MEURI protocol (compassionate use), and 80 patients under the RCT protocol.

In Butembo, Katwa, and Vuhovi health zones, response teams have continued to engage communities through various community dialogue platforms. Five community dialogue platforms have been organised in three health areas in Katwa, one health area in Butembo and one health area in Vuhovi. This initiative allows community members to participate and lead in decisions regarding Ebola response interventions in their localities. In other EVD-affected areas, ongoing activities include systematic collection of community feedback and responding to community concerns through adjustments of activities in consultation with community leaders and influencers. Community outreach activities are carried out in faith-based settings, market places, and schools with the collaboration of faith-based leaders and civil society groups (including women and youth). Civil society groups and community health volunteers also assist in the door-to-door community outreach activities on a regular basis.

Since the beginning of the outbreak to 19 March 2019, 980 EVD cases1 (915 confirmed and 65 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (554) were female and 30% (293) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 130 of 339 health areas across 21 health zones of the North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1). Overall, 610 deaths (case fatality ratio: 62%) have been reported, and 317 patients have been discharged after treatment in ETCs.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Attacks on ETCs in Katwa and Butembo represented the first large-scale and organized attacks targeted directly at the Ebola response, and were of a different order of magnitude to episodes of mistrust in communities or dangers of being caught in crossfire between fighting parties. In addition, the persistence of pockets of community resistance and mistrust, exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas; reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, collectively increase the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increased risk of geographical spread within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. As do the risk of increased population movement anticipated during periods of heightened insecurity.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

For more information, see:

1The number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and the availability of laboratory results.",In the last 21 days 97 new cases have been reported with 3 main outbreaks Katwa Masereka and Mandi httpstcotXQ0QBahw4,1 The armed assailants who attacked the Ebola treatment centers in Katwa amp Butembo didnt drive out the Ebola res httpstcojhOd9O6hIC,"Continuing a recent surge in new Ebola cases, the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) health ministry reported 11 more cases today, including 2 in Beni, an area that had been an epicenter earlier in the outbreak, bringing the outbreak total to 991 cases.

And in its weekly snapshot on the outbreak today, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the recent marked increase in cases that follows many weeks of decline isn't unexpected and partly reflects increased security challenges, especially direct attacks on Ebola treatment centers and pockets of community mistrust—events that bogged down the response for a few days.

DRC officials have logged 55 cases in the past 6 days.

Deaths include baby with unknown exposure

The 11 new cases announced today are in six locations, and all but Beni have reported other recent cases. They include Vuhovi (3), Beni (2), Mandima (2), Butembo (2), and 1 each in Katwa and Masereka.

Of the 991 total outbreak cases, 926 are confirmed and 65 probable. Health officials are still investigating 230 suspected cases.

Also, four more people in the DCR died from their Ebola infections, three in community settings in Katwa, Beni, and Mandima, and one at Butembo's Ebola treatment center. The developments lift the fatality count to 614.

The 11 new cases today comes on the heels of 12 new infections reported yesterday, which were detailed in a report late in the day from the DRC health ministry. Yesterday's cases included an illness from Bunia involving a 6-month-old baby whose parents are apparently healthy. An investigation is under way, including an analysis of breast milk, to determine the source of exposure to the virus.

The WHO had a few more details about the case in its update today, which said the baby died and that the case is the first in that health zone. An earlier case was reported from neighboring Rwampara health zone in early February.

Vaccination passes 90,000

In other developments, the health ministry today noted that the number of people vaccinated with VSV-EBOV has passed 90,000 and has now reached 90,351.

Also, it said a brainstorming session following attacks on the response in Butembo and Katwa resulted in a plan to bolster community engagement by establishing local Ebola virus committees in areas reporting the most community resistance, an approach that was useful in battling resistance in Beni's Ndindi district.

So far, 21 areas have been targeted for setting up the Ebola committees, including 8 in Butembo, 7 in Katwa, and 6 in Vuhovi. Local committee members will be trained on how to help with response operations, such as household decontamination and surveillance.

Some encouraging signs amid challenges

In its overview today, the WHO said Katwa, Butembo, Masereka, and Mandima are the hot spots, accounting for 80% of cases over the past 3 weeks. It added that response teams are fully operational in all areas.

Despite ongoing security challenges, it said it sees some glimmers of improvement in community acceptance to response efforts. For example, more than 90% of people eligible for the vaccine have received it, and more than 90% of them have participated in follow-up visits.

Field testing of suspected Ebola cases is keeping pace, analyzing 1,300 samples weekly, and the aid group ALIMA is scaling up capacity at the Katwa transit center.

Ebola responders are engaging with community members through dialogue platforms in Butembo, Katwa, and Vuhovi, the WHO said.

""This initiative allows community members to participate and lead in decisions regarding Ebola response interventions in their localities,"" the agency added.

The rest of the cases originated in current hot spots, including Katwa and Butembo.

The spike in cases pushed the outbreak total over the 1,000-case milestone as it enters its eighth month. This is the DRC's 10th and largest Ebola outbreak, and the second biggest in history.

The outbreak now stands at 1,016 cases, of which 951 are confirmed and 64 are probable. A total of 634 deaths have been recorded, and 226 suspected cases are still under investigation.

Call on community to end outbreak

On Sunday, DRC health minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, issued a statement on the 1,000 case milestone.

Though he noted that more than 91,000 people have been vaccinated against the virus, and patients in Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) have a 60% survival rate, healthcare workers will not be the key to ending this outbreak.

""The response begins at the level of the mother who brings her sick child to the health center and accepts that a sample is taken for the laboratory. It is also based on the head of the family, who accepts that all family members are vaccinated after one of them has been infected with Ebola,"" Kalenga said.

Since Friday, several of the deaths recorded have taken place in the community, which increases the risk of spread among case contacts.

Vaccination with Merck's VSV-EBOV vaccine is ongoing. As of today 91,286 people have been vaccinated, including 22,708 in Katwa and 21,056 in Beni.

Groups weigh in on milestone

The 1,000-case milestone brought with it a renewed public commitment from the World Health Organization (WHO).

""This outbreak has gone on far too long. We owe it to the people of North Kivu to work with them in solidarity not only to end this outbreak as soon as possible, but to build the health systems that address the many other health threats they face on a daily basis,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, WHO director-general.

In a statement from the International Rescue Committee (IRC), which is helping 59 facilities in the outbreak region with infection control and working to protect women and children, Tariq Riebl, IRC's Emergency Response Director in the DRC, said the 58 cases recorded in the last week show an alarming spike in activity.

He also said that, given the violence and community mistrust of response workers, more cases are likely unreported.

""We are already almost seven months into this outbreak and at this stage we should be seeing the case rate declining, not on the rise. With an optimistic outlook this outbreak is predicted to last another six months—but realistically we could be looking towards another year of fighting this disease,"" Riebl said.

Mar 24 IRC statement",no result found,no result found,"DAKAR (Reuters) - Congo’s Ebola epidemic has now exceeded 1,000 cases, the Health Ministry said on Monday, with a death toll of 629 in the world’s second worst ever outbreak.

Health workers have been better prepared than ever for this latest epidemic of the hemorrhagic fever, which causes severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding, and kills more than half those it infects. New technologies like a trial vaccine, experimental treatments and futuristic cube-shaped mobile units for treating patients have helped curb the spread of the virus.

But public mistrust and rampant insecurity in the parts of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where Ebola has struck have hampered the response, complicating the fight against it.

Five Ebola centers have been attacked since last month, sometimes by armed assailants. The violence led French medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) to suspend its activities at the epicenter of the outbreak last month.

As a result, it is now the second-deadliest in history, behind the 2013-16 one in West Africa that is believed to have killed more than 11,000 people.

“The total is now 1,009 cases,” the ministry said in a statement, but it added: “the response, led by the Health Ministry in collaboration with its partners, has limited the geographical spread.”

Last Wednesday, authorities confirmed a case of Ebola in Bunia, another city of close to 1 million people.",no result found

In other developments, Oxfam, one of the nongovernmental agencies working in the region, weighed in on ongoing challenges in the outbreak, and the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office provided a snapshot of events in its weekly update.

Latest cases in 3 hot spots

The six new cases are from three different locations. Katwa, the main epicenter, reported two, as did two smaller hot spots—Mandima and Vuhovi.

The developments lift the overall outbreak total to 1,022 cases, which includes 957 confirmed and 65 probable infections. Health officials are still investigating at least 161 suspected cases, but that total may be higher, because the ministry said health zones covered by the Butembo office couldn't report because of an internet connection problem.

Five more people died from their infections, four of them in community settings in Katwa and Mandima and one at Butembo's Ebola treatment center.

In other developments, the ministry said community dialogues in the wake of attacks on Ebola treatment centers resulted in several recommendations, and that the outbreak response has targeted two of them: infection prevention and control and risk communication/community engagement.

It said infection prevention teams will be taking steps to curb transmission in health facilities and in the community, such as disinfection, installing handwashing points, and providing personal protective equipment. A workshop on infection prevention was recently held in Goma, and a similar one on risk communication and communication is wrapping up in the city, with recommendations due soon.

Oxfam airs concerns over local elections

Along with other groups that have marked the DRC's eclipsing of the 1,000-case mark, Oxfam yesterday warned that humanitarian access to the outbreak region has deteriorated in the wake of the most recent attacks on Ebola treatment centers and community trust is almost nonexistent.

Oxfam's work in the region involves public health promotion, supporting community-led efforts to break transmission chains, providing clean water, and improving health center infrastructure.

In a news release, Tamba Emmanuel Danmbi-saa, Oxfam's DRC humanitarian program manager, said the growing presence of police and military is fanning the flames and making people even more frightened.

""While there is an imperative to protect staff in the field, using security forces during the Ebola response should be done with extreme caution,"" Danmbi-saa said. ""If communities feel that they are being coerced into vaccination or decontamination they lose trust in the response. Building that trust is vital to stopping the spread of the disease.""

Other groups have raised concerns about the role of police and military in the outbreak, and earlier this month the DRC's health ministry said there were misunderstandings about its involvement in response activities, though he acknowledged that police escorts of response teams in less secure areas had been perceived with suspicion.

Focusing only on the medical issues isn't enough to contain the epidemic, Danmbi-saa said, adding that health workers need to prioritize the affected people, not just the disease. ""There needs to be a real change in the response to end the epidemic as soon as possible.""

Also, the group said that upcoming local elections, scheduled for Mar 30, may trigger more violence. Voting in the national general election was postponed for the outbreak region, which raised suspicions that Ebola was being used as a political ploy. The rest of the country voted on Dec 30 to elect a new president and members of the National Assembly.

Results were announced on Jan 10, and one of the opposition candidates, Felix Tshisekedi—amid allegations of vote rigging from the other opposition candidate—was sworn in as president on Jan 24, with the outgoing president's party winning the majority of National Assembly seats.

WHO notes reversal of declining trends

In a weekly diseases and health emergencies update from its African regional office today, the WHO said moderate-intensity transmission continues in the DRC, with a slight reversal in declining activity over the past several weeks. It added that more health zones reported at least one confirmed case over the past 3 weeks.

Katwa is still the main hot spot, but several recent cases have also been reported in Masereka, Mandima, and Butembo, the WHO said.

The agency added that pockets of mistrust and insecurity are still challenging for contact follow-up and other measures, but it notes that transmission has stopped in many areas.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, appointed Graaff, who previously served as the WHO's director of Ebola emergency response in Liberia and West Africa.

Graaff, a Dutch national, will be based in Kinshasa and will coordinate the outbreak response with both the WHO and the DRC government. During a radio address made from Kinshasa today, Graaff said, ""We are talking about 'cases' and 'containment' to use scientific terms, but behind every case there is a person, a family and a community that suffers.""

Graaff's appointment comes just days after the DRC hit the 1,000-case mark amid a spike of virus activity.

'Daily challenges'

""Currently, response teams are facing daily challenges in ensuring timely and thorough identification and investigation of all cases amidst a backdrop of sporadic violence from armed groups and pockets of mistrust in some affected communities,"" the WHO said in a situation report issued yesterday.

From Mar 4 to 24, officials confirmed 115 Ebola cases in 13 health zones. Katwa had the most cases (31), followed by Masereka (19), Mandima (17), and Vuhovi (15).

The new cases include healthcare workers, and the total number of healthcare workers now infected during this outbreak is 78. Thirty percent of cases as of Sunday, Mar 24 have been in children, and 57% involve girls and women.

As of today, the WHO Ebola dashboard shows a total of 1,029 cases, 7 more than yesterday. The death toll stands at 639.

Shifting response to the community

Community mistrust still overshadows the Ebola response, the WHO said. As of Sunday, only 78% death alerts were responded to successfully by safe and dignified burial teams, and the WHO notes there has been an increase in community deaths in the last 3 weeks.

To combat this, the WHO has established operational analysis and coordination centers focused on engaging the community.

""With the shift in strategy, the focus has been to transition ownership of the Ebola response interventions to local communities, particularly in the hotspots of Butembo, Katwa and Vuhovi,"" the WHO said.

""Nine Ebola community committees have been established in Katwa (two), Butembo (three) and Vuhovi (four) comprising of youth leaders, quarter chiefs, women's associations, traditional practitioners, and activists. They are responsible for making decisions on Ebola response activities within their localities.""

The WHO said that, despite the recent uptick, officials are seeing ample progress.

""There are still many areas in which disease transmission has stopped,"" the WHO said. ""Local and national authorities and partners must continue with the current proven and innovative public health measures, which will ultimately bring this outbreak to an end.""

By Nellie Peyton

DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A quarter of people surveyed in Democratic Republic of Congo’s Ebola hotspots believed the virus was not real, a study said on Wednesday, as the world’s second-biggest outbreak spreads.

Health workers said public mistrust is now the biggest obstacle to stopping the epidemic, which has infected more than 1,000 people in eastern Congo since July, with many refusing vaccines, resisting treatment and concealing symptoms.

Harvard University researchers found that trust in public authorities had already fallen in the cities of Beni and Butembo before Ebola hit, due to decades of conflict and poor governance.

“It’s been three years now that we saw a declining level of trust in those actors, and the Ebola crisis comes on top of that and accelerates the distrust,” said Patrick Vinck, author of the study published in one of The Lancet’s speciality journals.

“In some ways, we are now paying the consequences of many years of lack of interest and focus on this issue,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The world’s worst epidemic of Ebola, a hemorrhagic fever, killed more than 11,300 people in West Africa from 2013 to 2016.

The virus has infected 1,022 people and killed 639 in eastern Congo so far, according to the health ministry. In recent weeks, there has been on average eight new cases per day.

People who believed rumors that Ebola does not exist were 15 times less likely to seek formal health care and five times less likely to accept vaccination, found The Lancet Infectious Diseases study, based on 961 interviews in September.

Local militias are active in the area and health workers are often accompanied by police and soldiers for security, which makes villagers suspicious, aid workers said. Ebola responders and centers have been targeted in numerous attacks.

December’s presidential election was canceled in the affected areas, fuelling conspiracy theories.

Community resistance is highest in and around Butembo, the latest epicenter of the outbreak, said Jean-Philippe Marcoux, country director for international aid group Mercy Corps.

“We need to - as much as possible and rapidly - scale down the presence of security forces with response teams, because it is creating more harm than good right now,” he said.

Although the World Health Organization (WHO) and charities are running community engagement programs, these have not been well-integrated with the medical response, Marcoux added.

But building trust is a slow process, said WHO’s regional emergencies director Ibrahima Soce Fall.

“What worked in Beni might not work in Butembo because the communities are not the same,” he said.",no result found
28-Mar-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces saw a rise in the number of new cases this past week. At this time, response teams are facing daily challenges in ensuring timely and thorough identification and investigation of all cases amidst a backdrop of sporadic violence from armed groups and pockets of mistrust in some affected communities. Despite this, progress is being made in areas such as Mandima, Masereka and Vuhovi, where response teams are gradually able to access once again and acceptance by the community of proven interventions to break the chains of transmission is observed.

During the last 21 days (6 – 26 March), a total of 125 new cases were reported from 51 health areas within 12 of the 21 health zones affected to date; 38% of the 133 health areas affected to date (Figure 2). The majority of these cases were from remaining hotspot areas of Katwa (36), Butembo (14), and three emerging clusters in Mandima (19), Masereka (18) and Vuhovi (17), in addition to a limited number of cases in other areas (Table 1). All cases link back to chains of transmission in hotspot areas, with onward local transmission observed in a limited number of towns and villages within family/social networks or health centers where cases have visited prior to their detection and isolation.

As of 26 March, a total of 1029 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 642 died (case fatality ratio 62%). Of 1029 cases with reported age and sex, 57% (584) were female, and 30% (307) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 78 (8% of total cases), including 27 deaths.

Community engagement efforts to encourage greater local participation and ownership of the outbreak response is ongoing and has yielded some success in many areas. In Butembo and Katwa this past week, a total of 4171 households have been visited by community health volunteers and Red Cross volunteers. This past week also saw the establishment of nine community committees to enhance direct dialogue with healthcare workers and empower community members to partake in the decision-making process of the local response. Special dialogues are being held in the communities where there have been the most frequent incidents. Herein, an anthropologist first meets with the community to ascertain their concerns, then arranges for communal meetings where these concerns can be discussed, including amongst local youth leaders, women’s associations, traditional practitioners, and healthcare providers.

As of 26 March, 324 EVD patients have recovered and been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres. In Beni, local NGOs and international teams are currently conducting eye care training for ten ophthalmologists and establishing dedicated eye care clinics to provide screening and eye care for EVD survivors. To date, 145 survivors have been screened in these clinics and a total of 293 survivors have enrolled in the survivor’s programme.

Notable strides have also been made in improving IPC capacities in healthcare facilities. Since January, IPC field teams have decontaminated over 250 healthcare facilities and households, provided over 100 supply kits, and trained over 3000 healthcare workers in IPC. A recent National IPC workshop has been completed to aid the implementation of new IPC strategies, while the establishment of an IPC task force has further improved partner communication and coordination at all levels. The work is, however, is ongoing and IPC teams continue to respond to new instances of nosocomial transmission with the emergence of clusters in previously unaffected communities and health facilities.

These local successes do not come without its challenges. When visiting communities in high risk areas, Ebola response teams sometimes face security challenges. Though no major security incidents have been reported over the last 10 days, the overall situation remains fragile. WHO and partners have recently established operational analysis and coordination centres to both gain a more holistic understanding of how we can engage communities more effectively, as well as further increase operational awareness of the day to day operations to ensure the safety of frontline healthcare workers and the communities they are aiding. WHO and partners have also strengthened physical security in the treatment centres and accommodations of healthcare workers.

Finding a balance between providing adequate operational protection to community members at risk of Ebola and healthcare workers while simultaneously winning the trust of communities remains an iterative learning process. WHO is constantly evolving the response efforts to address these operational challenges and will continue to step up collaboration with communities to increase acceptance on the ground.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Attacks on ETCs in Katwa and Butembo represented the first large-scale and organized attacks targeted directly at the Ebola response, and were of a different order of magnitude to episodes of mistrust in communities or dangers of being caught in crossfire between fighting parties. In addition, the persistence of pockets of community mistrust, exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas; reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, collectively increase the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increased risk of geographical spread within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. As do the risk of increased population movement anticipated during periods of heightened insecurity.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

1The number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and the availability of laboratory results.","Ebola Situation as of Thursday, March 28, 2019 In total 1044 cases 978 confirmed and 66 probable 652 deaths and 325 p httpstcoWhmsrGPgJD",no result found,"The Ebola total in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) grew by 14 today, amid a fragile security situation in an outbreak region that is still experiencing sporadic violence and pockets of mistrust, according to the latest updates.

In a new research development, a survey of residents of Beni and Butembo that was conducted 1 month after the outbreak was declared found a link between mistrust of institutions and misinformation and fewer efforts to protect against the disease, including accepting vaccination.

In addition, a quarter of respondents questioned whether the disease even exists.

New Katwa cases include health workers

In its latest update today, the DRC's health ministry said 6 of the newly confirmed cases are in Katwa and four in Vuhovi.

Of the new cases in Katwa, two involve health workers who cared for patients in a facility in the Muchanga health area where several confirmed patients have died since Mar 10. In its report yesterday, the ministry said possible nosocomial spread had occurred at the facility, but decontamination—a key step for curbing the spread of the virus—couldn't be carried out due to community refusal.

Four other locations each have one new case: Beni, Lubero, Oicha, and Mandima. Officials added one more probable case, that of a nurse who died in early March after caring for a confirmed case-patient. Those new cases increase the number of health worker infections to 80, of which 27 were fatal.

The new illnesses boost the overall outbreak total to 1,044, which includes 978 confirmed and 66 probable cases. Also, outbreak responders are investigating 218 suspected Ebola cases.

Nine more people died from the virus, four of them in community settings in Vuhovi and Mandima, and five in Ebola treatment centers in Butembo and Mabalako. So far, 652 people have died from their infections.

WHO details challenges, signs of progress

Though no major security incidents have occurred over the last 10 days, Ebola response teams sometimes still face security challenges, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in an update today on the outbreak. Timely identification and investigation of cases is occurring against a backdrop of sporadic violence from armed groups and mistrust in some affected communities.

Despite the challenges, however, Ebola responders have made progress in emerging clusters in Mandima, Masereka, and Vuhovi, as they gradually regain access as well as community acceptance of steps known to break transmission chains, the WHO said.

A limited number of cases are occurring in other areas, but all of the cases are linked to transmission chains in hotspot areas, with some onward local spread within family networks and health centers where patients received care before they were diagnosed as having Ebola. For example, in today's health ministry update, officials said most cases in Beni recurred after a person from Mandima was moved there for treatment, with one linked to attending a funeral in Butembo.

The WHO referenced community engagement efforts that the health ministry has recently detailed, noting that, over the past week, community health workers and Red Cross volunteers have visited 4,171 households in Butembo and Katwa.

In another developments, international teams are in Beni training ophthalmologists and establishing eye care clinics for Ebola survivors, and so far 145 have been screened in the clinics and 293 have been enrolled in survivor programs.

Survey probes mistrust, misinformation

Meanwhile, a team led by Harvard University researchers yesterday published findings from an Ebola perceptions survey of people in Beni and Butembo in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. The group's goal was to tease out the role of trust and misinformation on infection prevention behaviors, given the outbreak's location in an area that has experienced regular violence over the past 20 years, alongside political instability—complex factors fueling many of the problems outbreak responders face.

The study included 961 randomly selected adults who were surveyed from Sep 1 to Sep 16, about a month after the DRC declared the current outbreak, which has become the world's second largest.

The investigators found that only 31.9% trusted that local authorities represent their best interest and that belief in misinformation was widespread, with 25.5% believing that Ebola isn't real.

They found that low institutional trust and belief in misinformation were associated with a decreased likelihood of adopting prevention measures and seeking healthcare.

Though in general, confidence in vaccines was high, levels were reduced for the Ebola vaccine, which might relate to fear of contamination, misperceptions about cost, or because it is new, the team wrote. And though they found a link between low trust, misbelief, and reduced adherence to steps to prevent Ebola, overall adherence was high, which the group said probably reflects the impact of local engagement efforts.

""Until trust building is effectively translated into response strategies and communication protocols, the basic principles of intensive risk communication by trusted sources in a transparent, sincere, and consistent manner should be the cornerstone of the social mobilisation and community engagement efforts,"" the team wrote.

Solutions to mistrust elusive

In a related commentary, Joe Trapido, PhD, with the department of anthropology and sociology at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the London School of Economics, wrote that as the authors of the study found, people in the DRC have learned to distrust authority in ways that make it difficult for public health interventions to gain traction.

However, he notes that solutions to trust problems are much more difficult than identifying them. He urged health responders not to mistake local gatekeepers with community in a ""violently divided"" society like the DRC. Trapido said the strength of the survey is the attention given to ordinary people.

He urged experts to consider replacing the term misinformation with rumor, which reflect a more complex social phenomena. There is much that outbreak responders can learn from local views, which guide how people respond to health interventions, he wrote. ""And it is only by listening and understanding, free of the kind of prior judgements that the term misinformation implies, that interventions can be made more effective.""

Mar 27 Lancet Infect Dis abstract

Mar 27 Lancet Infect Dis commentary","One in four people interviewed in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) last year believed Ebola wasn't real, according to a new study, underscoring the enormous challenges healthcare workers are now facing.

Health workers said public mistrust is now the biggest obstacle to stopping the epidemic, with many refusing vaccines, resisting treatment and concealing symptoms, as the world's second-biggest Ebola outbreak spreads.

This mistrust resulted in people being 15 times less likely to seek medical treatment at an Ebola health centre, according to the study published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal.

The study, released on Wednesday, was based on interviews conducted last September, about a month after the outbreak began. It comes as the number of probable and confirmed cases exceeds 1,000.

At least 639 people have died from Ebola in eastern DRC since August in what is now the second-deadliest outbreak in history, according to the World Health Organization.

In recent weeks, there have been, on average, eight new cases a day, said the country's health ministry.

The response to the outbreak has been hampered by a series of deadly attacks on Ebola health centres since the study was completed. As a result, Doctors Without Borders has stopped staffing two health centres at the outbreak's epicentre after violent attacks.

Researchers found that trust in public authorities had already fallen in the cities of Beni and Butembo before Ebola hit, due to decades of conflict and poor governance.

Accelerated distrust

""It's been three years now that we saw a declining level of trust in those actors, and the Ebola crisis comes on top of that and accelerates the distrust,"" said Patrick Vinck of Harvard University, who led the research.

""In some ways, we are now paying the consequences of many years of lack of interest and focus on this issue.""

Eva Erlach, the community engagement and accountability delegate for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), said the findings show how the level of trust correlates with preventive behaviours.

The organisation has had more than 800 trained volunteers working to get prevention messages out amid the region's security challenges.

""There is still a part of the community who do not believe that Ebola is real and we definitely still need to continue focusing on community engagement,"" said Erlach, who was not part of the study. ""And this is why this report is so helpful, even if it's from September.""

190307192400361

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said earlier this month he was encouraged ""to see the communities accepting the response more and more"".

The study highlights just how pervasive misinformation has been in places in eastern DRC like Beni and Butembo, where in-person interviews were conducted with 961 people.

Some 25.5 percent of those interviewed did not believe Ebola was real. In addition, nearly 45.9 percent of people thought the Ebola outbreak was being fabricated to destabilise the region or for financial gain.

Additionally, 18.2 percent believed all three of those statements, the study found.

Volatile security situation

Those who didn't believe Ebola was real were far less likely to agree to take the Ebola vaccine or go to a treatment centre. Ebola is spread through the bodily fluids of those infected, and isolating them is key to stopping transmission.

This outbreak has been uniquely challenging because of the volatile security situation in the region. Eastern DRC is home to numerous armed groups and the Ebola epidemic has deepened the political and economic grievances of many in the area. The fact that people in Ebola-affected areas were excluded from voting in the December presidential election has only heightened conspiracy theories.

Tariq Riebl of the International Rescue Committee, who is currently working in eastern DRC, said the findings released Wednesday mirror what he and his colleagues are seeing on the ground. Concern remains about how Ebola prevention efforts are going because new cases are still emerging.

""Once you reach a wider outbreak zone, especially urban zones, the community engagement and prevention side of things is almost more important than the treatment side,"" Riebl said.

""If you can't have those messages out successfully, it doesn't matter if you have all the treatment options available because no one is ever arriving to take advantage of that,"" he said.

In other developments, a US research team announced yesterday it has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance to use animal models in its development of remdesivir, one of the experimental treatments being used to treat patients in the DRC outbreak.

Infections push total to 1,059

All of the 15 newly confirmed cases are from the main epicenters and other smaller hot spots that have recently reported cases. Five are in Vuhovi and 4 in Katwa, and three locations each have 2 cases: Mandima, Oicha, and Beni.

The infections boost the country's overall case total to 1,059, including 993 confirmed and 66 probable cases. Yesterday the DRC confirmed 14 cases, so today's numbers make it the largest 2-day increase in the history of the outbreak.

Health officials are also investigating 225 suspected Ebola cases.

Also, 8 more people died from their infections, 4 of them in community settings—3 in Katwa and 1 in Vuhovi. Deaths that occur in the community are a concern, because viral levels are highest during the severe stages of illness and at death, raising the risk of further spread in settings where people aren't wearing personal protective equipment.

The other 4 fatalities occurred in Ebola treatment centers, including two in Butembo and two in Beni. The outbreak has now claimed 660 lives.

Remdesivir benefits from FDA Animal Rule

The US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) said yesterday that for the first time the FDA has allowed the use of the Animal Rule for developing a drug treatment for Ebola. Remdesivir, an antiviral known as GS-5734, is one of four experimental treatments authorized for compassionate use in the DRC's Ebola treatment centers, where clinical trials are under way for three of the treatments, including remdesivir.

In a news release, USAMRIID said a 2018 Ebola natural history study that it conducted in collaboration with Gilead Sciences, the drug's sponsor, paved the way for the Animal Rule agreement. The Geneva Foundation is another collaborator, and the work was funded by the Joint Project Manager for Medical Countermeasure Systems, part of the US Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense.

The FDA agreed that using rhesus macaques infected by intramuscular injection is a relevant and adequately characterized model of Ebola infection to support filing under the FDA Animal Rule, designed to apply to the drug approval process when human efficacy trials are not feasible or ethical.

As part of the agreement, the FDA said the rhesus monkey model is sufficient as a single-animal model for drug development and that a specific delayed time-to-treat approach is appropriate for future nonclinical studies to assess remdesivir's efficacy.

Col Gary Weaver, USAMRIID commander, said that, over the years, Ebola countermeasures have been subject to regulatory uncertainties regarding which models, if any, would be acceptable to the FDA for evaluating efficacy under the Animal Rule.

""The study design and data-quality posture USAMRIID adopted for the Ebola virus NHS sets a precedent that has the potential to be useful for medical countermeasure development efforts targeting other similar human pathogens, such as Marburg or Sudan viruses,"" he said.

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo on Friday recorded 15 new confirmed cases of Ebola, the biggest one-day rise since the current outbreak was declared last August, the health ministry said.

Coming a day after 14 new cases were confirmed, the number means the outbreak is on track to register one of its highest weekly case totals, despite health officials saying as recently as two weeks ago that it was largely contained and could be stopped by September.

Health workers have brought new tools to the fight against the latest epidemic of the hemorrhagic fever, including a vaccine and several treatments, but community mistrust of first responders and militia violence have set back the campaign.

Five Ebola centers have been attacked since last month, sometimes by armed assailants. The violence led French medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) to suspend its activities at the epicenter of the outbreak last month.

The current outbreak of the virus, which causes severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding, is the second largest in history behind the 2013-16 West African epidemic that killed more than 11,000 people.

The center run by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in the district of Katwa was set on fire on Feb. 24 by unknown attackers, forcing staff to evacuate patients.

It re-opened on Saturday, the ministry said in a statement.

“For now it is managed by the ministry in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF,” it said, referring to the United Nations children’s fund.

Aid workers have faced mistrust in some areas as they seek to contain the Ebola outbreak, which has become the most severe in Congo’s history. The WHO has said the distrust is fueled by false rumors about treatments and preference for traditional medicine.

Another MSF center in Butembo was also attacked in late February but reopened a week later.

MSF has pulled out from the area since the two attacks and has not said when it might resume medical activities.

As the outbreak turned the page to a new month today, the World Health Organization's (WHO's) online Ebola dashboard puts the outbreak total at 1,089 cases, which likely reflect 7 more new cases.

The surge in March cases followed attacks on Ebola treatment centers in Katwa and Butembo in late February, which temporarily slowed key response activities such as case finding and contact tracing. All told, the DRC reported 194 new cases and 119 deaths in March, the busiest month of the outbreak, which began in August 2018.

In a new development, the health ministry announced on Mar 30 that the Ebola treatment center in Katwa, one of the outbreak's main hot spots, has reopened.

And yesterday people in Beni and Butembo voted in national general elections that were supposed to happen in late December but were delayed because of Ebola activity. The delay had sparked suspicion that Ebola was being used as a political tool, but voting proceeded smoothly in parts of Beni where unrest and armed militias have often been reported, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported yesterday.

People weren't eligible to vote in the presidential election, which has been decided, but there were 15 parliament seats up for voting in areas where the vote had been delyed.

Cases span range of hot spots

Of the 23 new cases reported over the weekend, 7 were Katwa, 6 were from Vuhovi, 4 in Mandima, and 2 in Beni. Four locations each had a single case: Oicha, Mambasa, Masereka, and Musienene.

The case in Mambasa, which would have been a first for that health zone in Ituri province, was reclassified as a case from Mandima after investigators found that the girl became ill there before she sought care in Mambasa where her parents live, the health ministry said in its Mar 31 update.

The newly confirmed infections lifted the overall case total to 1,082, which included 1,016 confirmed and 66 probable cases. Investigations are still under way into 279 suspected Ebola infections.

Of 16 new deaths reported over the weekend, 10 people died in community settings, which is known to increase the risk of virus spread. The community deaths occurred in Katwa, Vuhovi, Mandima, and Masereka.

Six patients died in Ebola treatment centers, four in Butembo and two in Beni. The new developments raise the outbreak's fatality count to 676.

Katwa treatment center reopens

In its Mar 30 update, the health ministry said Butembo's Ebola treatment center is full, following a mid-March wave of cases in Masereka, Katwa, and Vuhovi, which made rebuilding Katwa's Ebola treatment center a priority.

Before the center was rebuilt, however outbreak responders met with district leaders to come up with a plan to rebuild in a way that would tie in community ownership. The ministry said social anthropologists have played a key role in rebuilding the treatment center with recommendations that neighborhood leaders organize meetings to ensure transparency in recruiting local workers and asking that traditional chiefs perform rituals before cleaning and rebuilding began at the treatment center.

""It was also important to sensitize all workers and the community at large about the importance of seeing the CTE as a community property where all members of this community can entrust their patients so that the experts take care of them with respect,"" the ministry said.

The Katwa treatment center is now managed by the health ministry, with collaboration from the WHO and UNICEF. According to the report, it is staffed by local health workers.

The message came from Ibrahima-Soce Fall, MD, WHO assistant director-general for emergency response, who held a brief teleconference this morning from Butembo.

With 72 Ebola cases reported last week and 56 in the previous week, March was a low point for responders, as activity spiked and the outbreak topped the 1,000-case milestone.

""But of 21 health zones with Ebola, we have only 13 recorded cases in recent weeks, which shows a kind of geographic limitation to the outbreak,"" Fall said. ""We are continuing [to adapt] our tactics.""

Fall said Butembo and Katwa remain the hot spots of virus activity. And the outbreak already approaches 1,100 cases, with 3 new infections noted today.

Cases follow violence

The community-led tactics that Fall described include surveillance and vaccination and, most important, according to Fall, the recruitment of locals in response activities.

Without local health workers, he explained, response teams deal far too often with vaccination hesitancy, refusal of follow-up surveillance, and general mistrust of the ""riposte"" or foreign-led outbreak response.

According to the most recent outbreak situation report from the WHO's regional African office, Katwa reported 28% (44/160) of all confirmed cases in the past 21 days. Vuhovi, Mandima, Masereka, and Butembo recorded 20%, 15%, 12%, and 8%, respectively.

""Following recent episodes of violence, there has been an increase in the weekly number of cases, after many weeks of overall decline,"" the WHO said. ""Contact follow-up and community reluctance to report suspicious deaths, with subsequent un-safe burials, continue to be a problem.""

Recent cases include health worker

As of today, DRC officials confirmed 1,092 cases of Ebola, with 81 of those occurring in healthcare workers, representing 7.4% of all confirmed and probable cases. Twenty-eight healthcare workers have died. The overall case-fatality rate for the outbreak stands at 62%.

Officials confirmed 3 new cases today, 1 each in Katwa, Butembo, and Mandima. Seven new deaths were recorded in the past 2 days, including 2 community deaths in Katwa and 1 in Vuhovi. So far 683 deaths have been recorded since the outbreak began last August.

As of today, 93,996 persons have been vaccinated , including 23,310 in Katwa, 21,394 in Beni, 11,399 in Butembo, 6,109 in Mabalako, and 3,559 in Mandima. Officials are using Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine.

In the WHO's regional report, the organization noted resistance to vaccination in the Kaniyi health area of Masereka health zone.

In addition, another research team described how blood from vaccine trial participants might lead to new antibody treatments.

The new DRC cases are reflected in the World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard, which notes that 277 suspected cases are still under investigation. The number of deaths held steady, at 683.

Treatment units tied to fewer infections

To help sift out which risk factors are linked to secondary Ebola spread, a research team from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and their collaborators in Guinea analyzed 860 cases in 129 transmission during the last half of Guinea's Ebola outbreak. They described their findings today in an early online edition of the American Journal of Epidemiology.

Ring vaccination was under way during the trial, and, to adjust for it as a confounder, the investigators removed participants from the study analysis.

Focusing on characteristics that led to secondary transmission, they found that admission to an Ebola treatment unit was associated with a 38% decrease in secondary cases in people who did not survive their infections. Another key factor was unsafe burial, which was associated with a nearly doubled transmission rate.

Similar to the results of earlier studies, most cases didn't involve secondary transmission, and a small number of cases were linked to many transmission events. When the researchers analyzed the patterns further, they found that the first generation of each transmission chain was linked to a higher number of secondary cases than those for later chains.

Children and young adults had lower onward transmission, and older adults were more likely to spark numerous secondary cases, perhaps owing to behavioral differences in caring roles, the group wrote.

Three quarters of transmission involved households, with the researchers noting that studies from earlier in the epidemic found higher contributions from funeral and nosocomial transmission.

Analyzing transmission patterns provides key insights and helps guide the public health response, the team concluded. ""Recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo indicate the vital importance of epidemiologically-informed control measures in the control of Ebola,"" they added.

Monoclonal antibodies from vaccinated people

Vaccine trials may provide an opportunity to isolate antibody therapies for Ebola and other diseases, a research team based in the United Kingdom reported yesterday in Cell Reports.

First, the scientists examined monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from the blood of volunteers who were vaccinated with ChAd3, a modified adenovirus vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, boosted with modified vaccinia virus Ankara.

From 11 vaccinated donors, the researchers isolated 82 antibodies with capacity to bind the Ebola virus glycoprotein, 20 of which showed some level of cross-reactive binding to glycoproteins in Bundibugyo and Sudan Ebola species.

They then tested a cross-reactive cocktail of four antibodies in guinea pigs experimentally infected with Ebola, administering the treatment on day 3 of infection, which resulted in complete protection.

The authors concluded that an Ebola vaccine trial provides a valuable opportunity to isolate human mAbs with therapy potential. ""We suggest that isolation of mAbs should accompany all experimental vaccine trials for emerging pathogens, for which specific therapies are lacking,"" they wrote.

Apr 2 Cell Rep abstract",no result found,no result found,"(The April 1 story corrects paragraph 5 to show more than half of last week’s deaths occurred outside treatment centers, not three quarters)

GENEVA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo’s Ebola outbreak is spreading at its fastest rate yet, eight months after it was first detected, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday.

Each of the past two weeks has registered a record number of new cases, marking a sharp setback for efforts to respond to the second biggest outbreak ever, as militia violence and community resistance have impeded access to affected areas.

Less than three weeks ago, the WHO said the outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever was largely contained and could be stopped by September, noting that weekly case numbers had halved from earlier in the year to about 25.

But the number of cases hit a record 57 the following week, and then jumped to 72 last week, said WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier. Previous spikes of around 50 cases per week were documented in late January and mid-November.

More alarmingly, more than half of the Ebola deaths last week occurred outside of treatment centers, according to Congo health ministry data, meaning there is a much greater chance they transmitted the virus to those around them.

“People are becoming infected without access to response measures,” Lindmeier told Reuters.

The current outbreak is believed to have killed 676 people and infected 406 others. Another 331 patients have recovered.

In the past two months, five Ebola centers have been attacked, some by armed militiamen. That led French medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) to suspend its activities in two of the most affected areas.

Another challenge has been a mistrust of first responders. A survey conducted last September by medical journal The Lancet found that a quarter of people sampled in two Ebola hotspots did not believe the disease was real.

Lindmeier said new approaches to community outreach were showing signs of progress and that some previously hostile local residents had recently agreed to grant health workers access.

One treatment center that closed in February after being torched by unknown assailants reopened last week.

4-Apr-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

This past week saw a marked increase in the number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. During the last 21 days (13 March to 2 April 2019), 57 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases; 42% of the 135 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 172 confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (50), Vuhovi (34), Mandima (28), Masereka (18), Beni (13), Butembo (12), Oicha (8), Kayna (3), Lubero (3), Kalunguta (1), Bunia (1) and Musienene (1). WHO and partners will continue to adapt our strategies and strengthen response efforts to limit the further spread of EVD in these health areas.

As of 2 April, a total of 1100 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 690 died (case fatality ratio 63%). Of the 1100 cases with reported age and sex, 58% (633) were female, and 29% (320) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 81 (7% of total cases), including 27 deaths.

To date, a total of 338 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged. As part of a broader programme to provide care for Ebola survivors and build sustainable, local response capacity, an eye care training programme and clinic was completed this week in Beni through the combined efforts of WHO, Ministry of Health, and a team of ophthalmologists from Emory University and the University of North Carolina. A total of 252 EVD survivors were screened in the eye clinic and ten national ophthalmologists were trained to provide higher level eye care in their communities. Feedback from participating national healthcare providers and enrolled survivors was overwhelmingly positive. Of note were some of the clinical findings witnessed in the present cohort of EVD survivors. The team noted that complications such as uveitis were observed at lower rates when compared to cases from the 2014-16 West Africa EVD outbreak.

A Risk Communication and Community Engagement partners meeting was held in Goma from 25-26 March, involving more than 80 participants representing the different partners participating in the outbreak response. The discussion focused on engagement strategies that have worked in the past, what is working on the ground currently, and what needs to be improved to build upon our current gains and address future challenges.

The recent shift of emphasis in the response strategy to promoting greater engagement and ownership by affected communities is beginning to produce results. While community reluctance and mistrust remain present in certain areas around Butembo and Katwa, other areas saw a notable decrease in resistance to the presence of response workers. Diligent efforts at engaging with community committees through direct dialogue resulted in the reopening of the ETC in Katwa, bringing the total number of operational facilities providing care up to six ETCs in Beni, Butembo, Goma, Komanda, Mangina, and six transit centres in Beni, Bunia, Katwa, Kayna, Bwanasura, and Oicha. A more proactive approach to investigating and resolving incidents in the communities is also being undertaken to minimise the risk of misunderstandings and to mitigate potential sources of mistrust between local residents and healthcare providers.

The increase in the number of cases this week highlights the difficult environment the outbreak is occurring in, as well as the multitude of evolving challenges confronting the outbreak response on a daily basis. A holistic approach involving rigorous implementation of proven measures to break chains of transmission, thorough contract tracing, continued vaccination of high-risk contacts, and persistent efforts in community engagement must be persevered with to curtail the spread of EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Attacks on ETCs in Katwa and Butembo represented the first large-scale and organized attacks targeted directly at the Ebola response, and were of a different order of magnitude to episodes of mistrust in communities or dangers of being caught in crossfire between fighting parties. In addition, the persistence of pockets of community mistrust, exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas; reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, collectively increase the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increased risk of geographical spread within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. As do the risk of increased population movement anticipated during periods of heightened insecurity.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

The 7 cases include 3 in Katwa and 1 each in Mandima, Vuhovi, Musienene, and Beni. In addition, officials noted 5 new deaths in confirmed patients, including community deaths in Vuhovi and Musienene.

The cases raise outbreak totals to 1,107, of which 1,041 are confirmed and 66 are probable. In total, there have been 695 deaths since the outbreak began last August in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

Eighty-two infected health workers

The healthcare worker in Musienene brings the total number of health workers infected during the outbreak to 82 (7.4% of all confirmed or probable cases), and 29 of them have died, the DRC said.

In an update released late yesterday, the DRC recorded 8 new confirmed cases, and 7 deaths, including 5 community deaths. Butembo and Katwa each had a community death, and Mandima recorded 3.

Community deaths have been a compounding factory of this outbreak, as they enable the virus to spread more easily among family members and funeral attendees.

DRC spotlights 3 hot spots

""The three main outbreaks of the epidemic during these 21 days are Katwa (44), Vuhovi (32) and Mandima (24) who together reported 62.5% (100/160) of all cases,"" the DRC said yesterday.

In all three areas, single neighborhoods housed most of the cases. In Katwa, 23 of 44 cases came from the Muchanga health zone. Half of the cases recorded in Katwa in the past 3 weeks involved community deaths.

""The main difficulties over the last 21 days were the absence of CTE [Ebola treatment centers] in Katwa following the armed attack, the reluctance of part of the community and insecurity in some health areas following activities of armed groups,"" the DRC said.

In Vuhovi, 17 of 32 reported cases were from Mutendero health zone. Twenty-eight percent of reported deaths were community deaths.

Mandima also reported a significant percentage of community deaths. ""Of the 24 reported cases, 10 were community deaths, or 41.7%,"" the DRC said. About 70% of cases came from the Biakato Mine health zone.

Three healthcare workers in Katwa are among recently confirmed case-patients, as are 2 in Vuhovi and 1 in Mandima.

In other Ebola developments, World Health Organization (WHO) vaccine advisors this week recommended that lactating women and babies older than 6 months be included in the Ebola ring vaccination campaign, and the DRC's health ministry today reported 10 more cases.

Bushmeat likely source of 2017 outbreak

The outbreak covered in the new study was the DRC's eighth and occurred in the remote Likati district of Bas Uele province in the northern part of the country. An international team of researchers from the DRC, Canada, Doctors Without Borders, and the WHO published its findings yesterday in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.

The outbreak began in late March of 2017, totaling eight cases, five lab-confirmed and three probable. Four people died from their infections.

The event was limited to a single transmission chain—two family members of the index patient probably contracted the virus while transporting the man to and from a traditional healer and health facilities. The secondary cases passed the disease to five more people.

The investigators concluded that the index patient was exposed to Ebola through close contact with bush meat when he butchered a wild boar. Also, there was a nonhuman primate brought to and sold at the local market.

Genetic analysis revealed a novel Ebola Zaire virus variant that was closely related to the initial Mayinga variant isolated in the DRC in 1976 and 1977.

The researchers also noted several notable factors that, besides the remote location, likely limited the scope of the outbreak. For example, a local nurse who was part of local training on rapidly identifying Ebola cases in 2016 first raised the alert. Also, because of unusual death circumstances and similar cases in a close community, the deceased patient's relative implemented an ad hoc protected burial, which included decontaminating some personal belongings.

The team said the examples highlight the importance of healthcare training and sensitization of local communities in areas where outbreaks are likely to happen. Also, they noted that the genetic findings show how stable Ebola is in the environment over many decades, highlighting the importance of understanding filovirus evolution and selection pressures involved in promoting the jump of specific variants to humans.

Vaccine for lactating women, babies

The recommendation on including lactating women and infants older than 6 months in Ebola vaccination campaign came from the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, which met in Geneva this week.

At a media telebriefing today marking the close of the meeting, Kate O'Brien, MD, MPH, who directs the WHO's department of immunization, vaccines, and biologicals, said the group was briefed on the vaccine's role in decreasing the magnitude of the outbreak.

In February, the DRC announced plans to include pregnant and lactating women in the vaccine protocol, and SAGE in an interim recommendation endorsed the action.

Alejandro Cravioto, MD, who chairs the WHO's SAGE group, said the action this week endorses an earlier decision made by the DRC health ministry's ethics committee to include pregnant and lactating women and babies younger than 1 year old in the ring vaccination campaign. He noted that infants are especially prone to Ebola infection.

Deaths top 700

The 10 new infections in the DRC today are part of an ongoing surge in activity that followed violence in late February against Ebola treatment centers in Katwa in Butembo.

Three are in Katwa, one of the main hot spots, and two are in Beni, the earlier main epicenter that is experiencing a new rise in cases. Five locations each have a single new case: Vuhovi, Mandima, Butembo, Kalunguta, and Mabalako.

The cases lift the outbreak total to 1,117, and health officials are still investigating 295 suspected cases.

Seven more people died from Ebola, including 5 in community settings, an occurrence that raises the risk of virus spread. The DRC's fatality count has now reached 702.

The new cases raise the outbreak total to 1,154, including 731 deaths, for a case-fatality rate of 63.3%. Nineteen of the recently reported cases were in Katwa, the main hot spot of virus activity since Jan 1. Butembo recorded 6 cases, Vuhovi 5, Mandima 4, Beni 2, and Oicha 1.

Beginning Apr 6 and through today, 29 deaths were recorded, including 13 community deaths. Community deaths, which take place outside of Ebola treatment centers, increase the risk of transmission to family members and funeral attendees. Today, the DRC said that, in North Kivu and Ituri, 53% of patients have been infected by family members.

Mobile help speed response

Yesterday the DRC health ministry published details about the laboratory units used by Ebola response teams in the region in an effort to fight the perception held by some local communities that labs were taking too long to give results.

The laboratories used in the outbreak are managed by the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB.)

""To date, seven mobile laboratories have been established in Beni, Bunia, Butembo, Goma, Katwa, Komanda and Mangina. This is the first time that the INRB has had the technical capacity to deploy as many mobile laboratories in the field as part of an active Ebola outbreak,"" the DRC said. The labs in Beni, Butembo, and Katwa handle hundreds of samples collected each day.

DRC to invest in outbreak area

Also over the weekend, the DRC health ministry took action to correct one of the common refrains heard in community outreach meetings held in recent weeks: The DRC and the World Health Organization (WHO) do not do enough to invest in the outbreak zones outside of Ebola response efforts.

On Apr 6, DRC's Minister of Health, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, said he had initiated discussions with the federal government to establish a medium- and long-term development plan to ""restore the region socially and economically.""

The first phase of the plan was implemented this week, with the recruitment of 1,000 people for road maintenance jobs in Butembo and Katwa.

Vaccine use in Rwanda

Finally today, the WHO tweeted that, beginning on Apr 15, 8,000 health workers in Rwanda will be vaccinated with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. Rwanda, like Uganda and South Sudan, will vaccinate at-risk populations near the DRC border in an effort to protect against the virus.

As of today, 96,664 people have received the vaccine in the DRC, including 24,136 in Katwa and 21,582 in Beni.

Also, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in one of its regular updates that it's concerned about rising activity in the wide area responders are covering and about continuing infections in health workers.

New case details

Of the 14 new cases, 7 are in Katwa—the main hot spot—and 3 are in Vuhovi. Four locations each have a single case: Butembo, Mandima, Masereka, and Beni. The new infections boost the overall outbreak total to 1,168 cases, which includes 1,102 confirmed and 66 probable cases. Health officials are still investigating 274 suspected cases.

Also, 10 more people died from their infections, 7 of them in community settings in Katwa, Vuhovi, Masereka, and Mandima. The developments lift the outbreak's overall fatality count to 741.

One of the community deaths involves a health worker in Vuhovi, which the ministry said raises the number of infected health workers to 86, which includes 31 deaths.

Two treatment centers expand

In its statement today, the health ministry detailed developments at Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) in Butembo and Katwa.

It notes that, during the first week of April, the Butembo facility discharged 17 patients, a record number that it says may reduce people's fear of being treated there. And though Butembo residents continue to die from Ebola in the community or local health facilities, an increasing number are agreeing to be transferred to the ETC after symptoms begin, which is known to improve survival.

Bed capacity has been increased for the ETCs in both communities, and at the one in Butembo, the number of health workers has been expanded from 62 to 90 nurses and from 14 to 32 doctors. All were recruited locally.

Experimental therapies are being used again at the treatment centers, but only through the compassionate use protocol and not in a clinical trial context that was in place before the centers were attacked in late February.

Pressure on contact tracing

In its update today, the WHO African regional office said eight health zones have reported cases in the past 3 days, which it added is a concerning development. They are Katwa, Beni, Vuhovi, Mandima, Butembo, Oicha, Kalungata, and Mabalako.

The rising number of cases and broad geographic spread makes contact tracing and adding to the case list difficult. ""At the same time, proven and innovative public health measures continue to control the outbreak in some areas,"" the agency added.

Katwa is still the main focus of the outbreak, and 35% of all confirmed cases have come from there over the past 3 weeks, the WHO said.

Health worker toll

Three more health workers have been infected with Ebola and were among the recently reported cases from Katwa, the WHO said.

One of the health workers died in the community, an occurrence known to increase the risk of transmission. Late confirmation of the worker's infection shows more efforts are needed to strengthen infection prevention and risk communication measures.

Efforts targeting community resistance continue, and health officials successfully defused a recent flare-up related to a confirmed case in Muchanga health area. The patient is now being treated in Butembo's ETC, and the family has been listed for monitoring and prepared for vaccination and household decontamination.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The deadly Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is far from contained, U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Mark Green said on Tuesday.

“In the last week we have seen a number of signs that the outbreak is far from contained. There’s a long way to go,” the top U.S. aid official told a U.S. congressional hearing.

The Ebola outbreak in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has killed more than 600 people.

But as the country grapples with the aftermath of Dec. 30 elections marred by fraud allegations, aid workers have faced mistrust in some areas as they seek to contain the outbreak, the most severe in Congo’s history.

Green said there is enough money to fight the outbreak, and that the United States is pushing for more vaccinations and the production of more vaccines. He said he is in close contact with international health officials.",no result found

The previous record was 16 cases, on Apr 7.

The spike in cases raises the outbreak total to 1,186, which includes 1,120 confirmed and 66 probable infections. Officials also confirmed 10 new deaths, raising the fatality count to 751. Ten of the new deaths occurred in the community, which raises the risk of disease spread.

Emergency committee to meet

In light of these developments, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, announced today he has reconvened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) on Ebola in the DRC.

According to a press release from the WHO emailed to journalists, the committee will meet on Apr 12 in Geneva to decide whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage the outbreak. This will be the second meeting of the committee on this outbreak; the first took place in October.

""A rising number of security incidents have been restricting access to affected communities in key areas, for vital operations such as surveillance, case investigation, contact tracing and vaccination,"" the WHO said.

""Transmission has intensified in Butembo/Katwa and surrounding health zones of Vuhovi and Massereka. These factors have led to an increase in cases reported in recent weeks, after a period of decline.""

Of the 18 cases recorded today by the DRC, 11 are in Katwa, 3 in Vuhovi, 3 in Mandima, and 1 in Beni.

WHO: 199 cases in 3 weeks

In its latest outbreak update yesterday, the WHO said 199 cases have been confirmed in the 21 days from Mar 18 to Apr 7.

Between Apr 1 and 7 alone, the DRC recorded 65 cases of the viral hemorrhagic disease, predominantly in Katwa, Mandima, Butembo, and Vuhovi, the WHO said. In total, eight health zones reported cases from Apr 5 to Apr 7, and in the past 3 weeks 13 health zones reported new cases. Katwa has the most Ebola cases in recent weeks, with 69.

In addition, cases recorded since Apr 7 illustrate even further that the month is shaping up to be the outbreak's worst, according to data from the DRC health ministry. Officials recorded 40 cases in the 3 days since Apr 7, or 105 in 10 days—more than 10 per day.

""The number of new confirmed cases continues to rise, and the geographical spread of these new cases makes robust contact tracing and line-listing difficult,"" the WHO said, noting that the continued infection of healthcare workers is of particular concern.

As of Apr 7, a total of 85 health workers had been infected with the virus, 30 fatally, the WHO said. The case-fatality rate of the outbreak stands at 63%, with 57% of cases occurring in female patients, and 29% in children.

In the first week of April, health officials in the DRC received an average of 1,100 alerts per day, of which an average of 992 (90.2%) were investigated within 24 hours of reporting. Officials have been able to track 83% to 87% of contacts, with 8,678 contacts currently under surveillance.

Vaccination, lab testing continues

Eight labs in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces currently test all samples for Ebola, and, as of this week, the laboratory in Katwa has been equipped to sequence whole-virus genomes in order to provide virus transmission chain analysis.

Medical teams in the outbreak zones are also holding specialty eye clinics for survivors, the WHO said in a news story today. After the West Africa outbreak of 2014-2016, researchers discovered that up to 20% of Ebola survivors develop significant eye problems

The WHO said ring vaccination campaigns continue in Beni, Katwa, Butembo, Mandima, Bunia, Vuhovi and Lubero health zones around confirmed cases, and in Goma for front-line providers. Officials have now vaccinated 97,376 people in the DRC, its health ministry said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday said it had reconvened an expert panel to consider whether an outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.

The panel, which first met on this issue in October 2018, will also give updated recommendations on how global health officials should manage the outbreak, the WHO said in a statement from its Geneva headquarters.

At least 740 people have died among the more than 1,100 infected in this epidemic, which began in August 2018.

Declaring the outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern”, or PHEIC, would ramp up the international response with a formal alert that puts governments on notice and helps to mobilize resources and research.

The WHO said that while the outbreak is contained to the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, efforts to bring it under control in these urban areas have been hampered by security and access problems. As a result, it said, Ebola transmission has increased in some areas.

“Though the risk of spread within the country and to neighboring countries is very high, the risk remains low globally,” the WHO statement added.

11-Apr-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The rise in number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases observed in the North Kivu provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues this week. During the last 21 days (20 March to 9 April 2019), 57 health areas within 11 health zones reported new cases; 40% of the 141 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 207 probable and confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (83), Vuhovi (41), Mandima (29), Beni (21), Butembo (15), Oicha (8), Masereka (4), Lubero (2), Musienene (2), Kalunguta (1), and Mabalako (1).

As of 9 April, a total of 1186 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 751 died (case fatality ratio 63%). Of the 1186 cases with reported age and sex, 57% (675) were female, and 29% (341) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 87 (7% of total cases), including 31 deaths. To date, a total of 354 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged.

WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has convened the Emergency Committee for a meeting on 12 April, to consider whether the current EVD outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and to provide recommendations.

Progress on the ground this week focused primarily on intensifying infection prevention and control (IPC) activities in and around outbreak hotspot areas. IPC teams are concentrating their efforts at addressing reluctance to decontamination activities amongst some local residents by actively engaging in regular direct dialogues with community leaders. Along with intensifying decontamination efforts, other IPC measures being undertaken include rapid evaluation of IPC practices in healthcare facilities and patients’ homes and identifying facilities at increased risk of contact with EVD cases. Results from these rapid evaluations demonstrated a range of IPC gaps depending on the type of facility, which were then promptly addressed through supplementary supervision. Reoccurring issues include limited knowledge of standard precautions, lack of triage and isolation capacity, insufficient supplies (e.g., of personal protective equipment), inappropriate waste management, and lack of capacity for decontaminating medical equipment. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining supportive supervision and mentorship at priority facilities throughout the response. WHO is confident that strengthening these IPC measures would be an integral means of slowing the spread of EVD in the outbreak areas.

WHO and partners in Risk Communication and Community Engagement are continuing with activities to build and maintain a trusting relationship between communities and the Ebola response teams. Dialogues with community committees are ongoing in the hotspot areas of Butembo, Katwa, and Vuhovi, and form a key part of a larger increase ownership of the Ebola response by the communities. Information about community disquiet are systematically collected and monitored to ensure that any misunderstanding leading to reluctance, refusal, or resistance of the Ebola response is followed up with and resolved as quickly as possible. This has been made possible by feedback from the community members, received through ongoing dialogue and various research activities within both the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and neighbouring areas.

In an effort to address the feedback received and specific concerns over the outbreak response, guided visits of the Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) in various affected areas have been organized. Students and community associations who attended these guided visits to the ETCs can see first-hand how EVD patients are treated and help stop the potential dissemination of misinformation surrounding EVD and the ongoing response efforts.

The security situation has remained calm for the past week as well. Provisional results released on 9 April by the Commission Électorale Nationale Indépendante concerning the national and provincial legislative elections in Beni, Butembo city (North Kivu), and Yumbi territory (Mai-Ndombe) have caused no significant unrest or disruption to outbreak response activities.

The continued increase in cases this past week reflects the complex reality of conducting an effective outbreak response in a geographically difficult area with a highly fluid population, intermittent attacks by armed groups, and limited healthcare infrastructure. Despite these challenges, WHO and partners remain committed to limiting the spread of EVD amongst these vulnerable populations through the continued strengthening of our multi-faceted response efforts.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Attacks on ETCs in Katwa and Butembo represented the first large-scale and organized attacks targeted directly at the Ebola response, and were of a different order of magnitude to episodes of mistrust in communities or dangers of being caught in crossfire between fighting parties. In addition, the persistence of pockets of community mistrust, exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas; reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, collectively increase the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increased risk of geographical spread within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. As do the risk of increased population movement anticipated during periods of heightened insecurity.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

In another concerning development, the country's health ministry said two workers at Butembo's airport were taken to the local Ebola treatment center after tests confirmed the virus. The small earthen airport receives only small carriers. The Air Rale agent and porter had attended an unsafe burial of a friend who died from Ebola.

Today, health officials vaccinated all of the airport's agents and disinfected facilities.

Cases top 1,200, plus 13 new deaths

Of the 20 new cases, all were from the large and small current hot spots, except for one case in Komanda in Ituri province, marking a reappearance of the virus there.

The new cases boost the overall total to 1,206 cases, including 1,140 confirmed and 66 probable infections. Authorities are still investigating 246 suspected cases.

Thirteen more people died from their Ebola infections, 6 of them in community settings, a situation known to increase the transmission risk. So far, 764 people have died.

WHO: Surge reflects complex challenges

In one of its regular updates today, the WHO said the surge in cases over the past week underscores the complex reality of responding to an outbreak in a geographically difficult area with a highly fluid population, sporadic attacks by armed groups, and limited healthcare infrastructure.

On a positive note, it said the security situation remained calm for the past week, even though the DRC's electoral commission released provisional election results from delayed voting in Beni, Butembo, and Yumbi territory. The agency added, however, that several factors such as the high proportion of community deaths in confirmed cases increase the likelihood of more transmission chains in affected areas and the risk of more spread.

In summing up progress made in the field over the past week, the WHO said infection prevention and control (IPC) teams stepped up efforts to tackle resistance to decontamination among local residents by doing rapid assessments in health facilities and at patients' homes. Lingering gaps include limited knowledge of standard precautions for Ebola virus disease (EVD), lack of triage and isolation capacity, short supply of personal protective equipment, inadequate waste management, and lack of ways to decontaminate medical equipment.

""WHO is confident that strengthening these IPC measures would be an integral means of slowing the spread of EVD in the outbreak areas,"" the group said.

And as part of efforts to improve community engagement and curb the flow of misinformation, health officials have arranged guided visits to Ebola treatment centers so that student groups and community associations, for example, can see first-hand how Ebola patients are treated.

Immune clues in 2-year Ebola survivors

In related research, antibody testing in West African Ebola survivors at the 2-year mark showed memory immune responses, including specific T-cell responses, against Ebola virus, a discovery that could lead to Ebola vaccines that offer longer lasting protection. Researchers from France will their findings at the upcoming European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) in Amsterdam.

T cells are a key part of immune response to viruses, but little is known about their response to Ebola virus. The team said their study marks the first time Ebola-specific T-cell responses have been shown in survivors 2 years after infection.

For their study, they examined the blood of 35 adults from a group of 802 survivors in Guinea's Ebola outbreak, characterizing the response of T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells to Ebola virus glycoproteins. Then, using gene expression profiling, they compared the blood of Ebola survivors to that of a control group of 39 Guineans who didn't have a history of Ebola infection.

All survivors had Ebola-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), confirming their past Ebola infection. Blood marker analysis showed that the survivors had persistent inflammation, which researchers said could explain some of the lingering symptoms, such as headache, fatigue, and muscle pain.

Lab experiments that involved stimulating mononuclear cells from Ebola survivors revealed memory T cells that could produce cytokines, hinting that the cells might be able to control or clear the virus.

Aurelie Wiedemann, PhD, who led the study and is from the Vaccine Research Institute in Creteil, France, said in an ECCMID press release, ""Our study of Ebola virus disease survivors could provide critical data to develop strategies for mimicking the resilience which some individuals have demonstrated after being infected, and help to better identify a correlate of protection against Ebola virus disease.""

Apr 11 ECCMID abstract",no result found,no result found,no result found,"With new case numbers rising at an alarming rate, the World Health Organization said Wednesday it will again look at whether the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo should be declared a global health emergency.

The announcement that a panel of outside experts — a so-called emergency committee — will meet Friday to debate the question came on a day when the DRC health ministry was expected to say 18 new Ebola cases had been identified. That marked the highest one-day increase in this epidemic, now in its ninth month.

“We’re at a critical time in this outbreak,” Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, told STAT.

advertisement

Osterholm said it was necessary to rethink the approach being taken to contain the epidemic, which was declared on Aug. 1. “Doing the same thing over and over again does not appear to be working,” he said.

This will be the second time an emergency committee has been asked to advise WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on whether this outbreak meets the criteria to be declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, known in global health circles as a PHEIC. The committee met in October and though it described the outbreak as very worrying, it recommended against declaring a PHEIC at that time.

To date the outbreak has not spread to other countries, which is thought to be one of the reasons a PHEIC has not been declared.

But it is occurring in what is effectively a conflict zone, a reality that time and again has impeded the response team’s ability to bring transmission to a halt. As of Tuesday there have been 1,186 cases and 751 deaths.

Every time there has been a surge in violence there has been a corresponding sharp rise in cases. But whereas the violence was directed at Congolese soldiers or the United Nations peacekeeping operation in the outbreak area last fall, increasingly the attacks have been directed at the Ebola outbreak response itself.

In late February, Ebola treatment centers at Katwa and Butembo were firebombed by armed assailants, putting both out of commission for a time. Doctors Without Borders, which had been operating those treatment centers, withdrew its staff, saying it could not ensure their safety. Both centers have since reopened and are being operated by the DRC ministry of health and the WHO.

Since those attacks, case numbers have soared, and an outbreak that looked in February like it was coming under control now looks far from it.

Community resistance to the control measures known to stop Ebola transmission remains high in Katwa and Butembo, hotspots that are fueling the outbreak at this point. Many infected people are refusing to go to treatment centers for care, choosing instead to stay at home. That accelerates spread of the disease because the people who care for these patients will almost inevitably become infected themselves in the process.

There was hope that an experimental Ebola vaccine, made by Merck, would help to contain the outbreak. And WHO officials insist that but for the vaccine, this outbreak would be many times more severe than it already is. More than 97,000 doses of the vaccine have been administered so far in this outbreak.

But failings of the response are undermining the vaccine’s effectiveness. The vaccine is being used in what is called a ring vaccination approach — it is being offered to people who are known contacts of cases and the contacts of the contacts, as well as health workers and other frontline workers. The idea is to prevent spread of the virus by protecting people who are in contact with cases.

For that approach to work, the Ebola response needs to be able to identify as many contacts as possible. But in many cases they have been unable to do the contact tracing work needed to draw up detailed lists; cases have occurred in neighborhoods or villages where it is unsafe for them to work. As a result, many people who should have been vaccinated have not appeared on the vaccination list.

The prolonged length of this outbreak has raised concerns that supplies of the vaccine might run out. Merck has promised to try to maintain a stockpile of 300,000 doses. At the time that figure was struck, 300,000 doses seemed like a large cushion. But this outbreak has made it clear the size of the stockpile will need to be revisited.

Newsletters Sign up for Daily Recap A roundup of STAT's top stories of the day. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:

On Tuesday the company revealed that to date it has shipped to the WHO 145,000 doses of the vaccine and has roughly another 195,000 doses that are ready to be shipped as needed. An additional 100,000 doses should be ready to be shipped within the next three months, Merck said.

The company said it continues to work to produce doses of the vaccine and is exploring options to make even more if needed.

Merck has started the process of applying to both the Food and Drug Administration and its European counterpart, the European Medicines Agency, to license the vaccine, which is currently known as V920."

""Although we have great concern about rising numbers in some regions, the outbreak has not spread internationally over many months,"" said Robert Steffen, PhD, the head of the committee, during press conference. ""There is no added benefit to [a] PHEIC, as excellent work is being done on the ground by WHO and its partner organizations.""

Agency taking recent surge seriously

Throughout the press conference Steffen, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, and assistant director-general Mike Ryan, MD, emphasized that recommending against a PHEIC was not a sign of complacency or a failure on the part of the WHO to take the outbreak's latest spike in cases seriously.

Today, the WHO's Ebola dashboard shows 14 new cases, raising the outbreak total to 1,220 cases since August. That follows record-breaking days of 18 cases on Apr 10 and 20 cases yesterday.

""Together we will increase our efforts even more,"" Tedros said. ""Working with communities to understand their concerns and needs, we will also step up support to neighboring countries.""

The lack of PHEIC designation also does not diminish the need to close a funding gap of $104 million, Tedros said.

""The gap slows surveillance activities, which leads to more cases,"" he said. ""I urge donors to step forward; stopping this outbreak is our collective responsibility.""

WHO defends successes, progress

In a question-and-answer session that at times put the WHO on the defensive, Ryan was quick to point out the successes seen in the outbreak.

""Most people in the community are accepting our interventions, we have over a 90% vaccination rate, and we know the outbreak would be much larger were it not for the vaccine,"" Ryan said.

He also explained that the record-breaking week still ongoing in the DRC was partly because WHO responders were allowed more access to communities and transmission chains in hot spots, such as Katwa, which means they were able to identify and reach more patients.

But Ryan was firm in refusing to give an estimate as to how long the outbreak will continue. ""One thing I do is not make: predictions with this virus,"" he said.

Tedros echoed Ryan, stating the WHO has never tried to contain an Ebola outbreak in such a ""complex"" environment.

The WHO emergency panel first decided not to declare the outbreak a PHEIC in October 2018.

MSF, Ron Klain respond to WHO

Doctors Without Border (MSF), which has been critical of the WHO's response, said today that the organization was still failing to control the outbreak.

""Whatever the official status of this outbreak is, it is clear that the outbreak is not under control and therefore we need a better collective effort. The virus has not spread to neighboring countries so far, but the possibility exists,"" said Gwenola Seroux, emergency manager at MSF in a press statement.

Ron Klain, the United States Ebola response coordinator during the West African outbreak, took to Twitter to criticize the WHO.

""The response is failing to get the disease under control,"" Klain said. ""This is particularly worrisome given that — unlike the Ebola response in 2014-15 — this effort has the benefit of a highly effective vaccine that can prevent the disease's spread.""

Klain called for the US government to step up its response efforts for this crisis, and quickly. The United States has not had feet on the ground in the DRC since September, when Trump administration officials removed personnel amid security concerns.

Declaring the epidemic a “public health emergency of international concern” would have signaled that greater resources and international coordination are needed.

The WHO’s independent Emergency Committee, which analyzed the latest data, said the disease was entrenched in several epicenters in the northeast and was being transmitted in health care settings.

It had not spread across borders to Uganda, Rwanda or South Sudan, but neighboring countries should shore up their preparedness, the experts said.

“It was an almost unanimous vote that this would not constitute a PHEIC (public health emergency of international concern) because we are moderately optimistic that this outbreak can be brought into control - not immediately, but still within a foreseeable time,” panel chairman Professor Robert Steffen told a news conference.

Dozens of new cases reported this week have been mainly in the epicenters of Butembe, Katwe and Vuhovi, said Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s health emergencies program.

“It’s quite a focused amplification of disease in a very specific geographic area,” Ryan said.

“But the disease there has risen because of lack of access to that community, we’ve fallen behind in starting vaccination rings,” he said, referring to attacks on health centers by armed groups in February that cut-off hotspot areas.

“Vaccine is proving to be a highly effective way of stopping this virus but if we can’t vaccinate people we cannot protect them,” he added, noting that nearly 100,000 people have been vaccinated.

Experts have declared four emergencies in the past decade: the H1N1 virus that caused an influenza pandemic (2009), a major Ebola outbreak in West Africa (2014), polio (2014) and Zika virus (2016).

Some experts expressed concern that the Emergency Committee was too narrowly interpreting WHO guidelines.

“This is a deeply concerning event, due to the pathogen itself, the total number of cases, the increase in cases just this week, and the difficulty of coordinating the response due to conflict - that needs to receive the appropriate level of attention,” health experts Rebecca Katz and Alexandra Phelan of Georgetown University in Washington D.C. said in a statement.

The Ebola outbreak - by far the biggest Congo has seen, and the world’s second largest in history - was declared by national authorities in August. It is concentrated in Congo’s North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

It has already infected at least 1,206 people, of whom 764 have died - giving a death rate of 63 percent.

Following a meeting of its expert committee, the UN health agency called for efforts to be redoubled to stop the deadly virus, noting that the recent spike in Ebola cases raises the risk of spread to other countries.

The outbreak announced on August 1 has become the second-deadliest in history, behind the West African one from 2014-16 that killed more than 11,300 people. DR Congo’s health ministry on Thursday reported 1,206 confirmed and probable cases, including 764 deaths.

This is the second time the expert committee has decided this outbreak is not yet a global emergency. Committee chair Robert Steffen called Friday’s decision unanimous and said the experts had feared making the declaration might even hurt response efforts. He did not give details but said experts were “moderately optimistic” the outbreak could be contained within a “foreseeable time”.

Ahead of the WHO announcement, a top Red Cross official said he was “more concerned than I have ever been” about Ebola’s possible regional spread.

Emanuele Capobianco, head of health and care at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, cited Congolese health ministry data showing 40 new cases over two days this week. He called that rate unprecedented in this outbreak.

To be designated a public health emergency of international concern, a situation must be “serious, unusual or unexpected”, threaten to infect other countries and require “immediate international action.”

Emergency declarations almost always boost global attention and donor funding. WHO has noted it is woefully short of the $148 million (€130m) it says is needed to fight Ebola for the next six months. To date, the agency has only received $74 million (€65m).

Funding shortages are hampering the #Ebola response in #DRC. We need a total of US$148m for all partners to fund the response until July. To date, we have only received US$74 millions.

This outbreak, occurring close to the borders of Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan, has been like no other. Mistrust has been high in a region that had never faced an Ebola outbreak before, and insecurity caused by rebel groups has hurt aid efforts.

Rebecca Katz, a global health security expert at Georgetown University, in a statement called WHO’s decision disappointing, saying the UN agency and its experts were “taking too narrow of an interpretation” of what constitutes an international emergency. She called the difficulty of coordinating the response “deeply concerning”.

Ahead of the announcement, Trish Newport, Doctors Without Borders’ representative in Goma, a major crossroads city close to the outbreak, said that declaring a global emergency wouldn’t necessarily help stop the epidemic.

“Bigger is not necessarily better,” she said and called for a new approach, saying that after nine months of the same strategy “the epidemic is definitely not under control”.

#Ebola in #DRC: “It is clear that the outbreak is not under control and therefore we need a better collective effort. The virus has not spread to neighbouring countries so far, but the possibility exists.” - Gwenola Seroux, Emergency Manager at @MSF MSF International (@MSF) April 12, 2019

Doctors Without Borders is calling for patients to be treated in existing health centres rather than Ebola-specific clinics: “It’s very clear that people do not like or trust the Ebola centres and they are not coming to be treated.”

Newport said 75 percent of new Ebola cases have no obvious link to previous patients, meaning that officials have lost track of where the virus is spreading.

WHO’s Dr Michael Ryan, who heads the emergencies programme, disputed that assessment, insisting that officials are eventually able to connect most Ebola cases to a previous patient after an arduous forensic process.

Previous global emergencies have been declared for the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas and the international attempt to eradicate polio. WHO was criticised for not declaring the 2014 Ebola outbreak an international emergency until nearly 1,000 people had died and the disease had spilled across borders.

Tariq Riebl, who is based in a current Ebola hot spot, Butembo, for the International Rescue Committee, said a major obstacle to stopping the outbreak is that officials are simply unaware of how many Ebola cases there are.

“We’re discovering people when it’s way too late,” he said, noting numerous cases were buried in secret and never reported to authorities. “Given the average number of cases we’re seeing now, this is not going to be over for at least another six months or more.”

The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo still does not warrant the declaration of a global health emergency, the World Health Organization said Friday — a decision that is sure to trigger substantial debate as the virus continues to spread unabated.

The case count in the 8-month-old Ebola outbreak, already the second largest on record, topped 1,200 on Thursday and has surged by double digits most days over the past two weeks — a far faster rate than earlier in the epidemic.

The decision was made by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on the basis of a recommendation by a committee of outside experts that has now concluded twice that the outbreak does not warrant an emergency declaration.

“I have accepted their advice,” Tedros, as he is known, said during a news conference in Geneva.

The panel’s chairman, Robert Steffen, said declaring an emergency would provide no added benefit given that the WHO was already receiving significant support for the effort to control the outbreak.

He acknowledged, though, that the committee was concerned by the recent spike in cases.

“But … there is an explanation for these rising numbers,” Steffen said, noting that the new cases are concentrated in or originating from Katwa and Butembo, where the outbreak response teams have had difficulty gaining the cooperation of the communities. “There was turmoil in these areas, which were just not accessible for a certain period of time.”

Given the success the response has achieved stopping transmission chains elsewhere, “we are moderately optimistic that this outbreak can be brought into control. Not immediately, but still within a foreseeable time,” Steffen said.

Declaring a public health emergency of international concern — called a PHEIC for short — would raise the level attention it receives from the WHO’s member countries. It would also likely increase the amount of human and financial resources that countries are willing to contribute to the effort to stop the outbreak.

Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, disagreed with the call.

“I do think it’s a mistake. I do think conditions have been met for declaring it. It’s at least as serious as public health emergencies of international concern that have been declared so in the past,” Inglesby told STAT. “And I think it’s a mistake because I think it could have drawn in more international attention, political will and support.”

More must be done to contain this outbreak, he insisted.

“It needs to be made clear to all those who are involved that the current course that we’re on, despite the resources being brought to bear, despite WHO being completely in and flat out, it’s not enough,” Inglesby said.

The WHO, which along with DRC’s ministry of health is leading the outbreak response, has been under pressure for some time to declare a PHEIC, which is a tool of the International Health Regulations, a treaty to which WHO’s member states are party. Its first decision not to do so came in October.

David Fidler, a professor of global health law at Indiana University’s Maurer School of Law, warned that such a declaration would not on its own change the trajectory of this outbreak.

“It’s not a Harry Potter wand,” Fidler said. “We need to be honest here. The IHR were not designed to deal with this. WHO is not equipped to deal with this.”

Fidler was referring to the fact that the outbreak is occurring in what is effectively a war zone. Multiple armed factions have been fighting the Congolese army for years. A United Nations peacekeeping operation has been in the region for the past two decades.

The danger in the affected region has meant some countries — including the United States — have declined to send personnel to the outbreak zone to help. Highly experienced experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for instance, have been barred from working at the epicenter of the outbreak.

Attacks against government and UN forces hindered the containment effort throughout the fall. Every time there was a major violent event, a spike in Ebola cases would follow. But in late February, the violence took a frightening turn, with armed attackers firebombing Ebola treatment centers in areas where transmission of the virus is most intense.

Suddenly a containment effort that had been making real progress saw gains evaporate. Doctors Without Borders, which had been operating the two treatment centers, withdrew its staff, saying it could not ensure their safety. Both centers have been rebuilt and are being operated by the ministry of health and the WHO.

Dr. Tom Frieden, who was CDC director during the gargantuan West African Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016, said he recently met with someone who has worked on the current response; the person told him of being shot at while in the field.

“It’s very hard to control disease when you’re shot at,” said Frieden, who is now president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative of nongovernmental organization Vital Strategies.

Frieden said controlling this outbreak will be very difficult. And he acknowledged there is real concern it could spread further, for instance into Goma, a city of 1 million people. Goma is a regional transportation hub that sits on Congo’s border with Rwanda. The concern has long been that if the virus starts to spread in Goma the risk that cases will be exported to other countries will rise significantly.

“Urban Ebola is a very different animal. Urban Ebola is very, very difficult to control,” Frieden warned."

The data — the first to be released on how the vaccine is working in the outbreak — suggest a “very impressive” performance by the vaccine, said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, who reviewed the report for STAT.

Of more than 90,000 people who were vaccinated, only 71 went on to develop Ebola. Fifty-six of those people developed symptoms fewer than 10 days after being vaccinated, suggesting the vaccine had not yet had time to fully protect them. It is believed it takes about 10 days for immune protection to develop after vaccination.

Only 15 people developed Ebola more than 10 days after being vaccinated, the report said. Seven of them were health-care workers. Nearly 29,000 health-care and front-line workers were among the roughly 90,000 vaccinated between last August and March 25, the time period covered by the report.

None of the people who developed Ebola 10 days or more after being vaccinated died from their illness.

“Notably, there were nine deaths among 56 cases with onset of symptoms 0 to 9 days after vaccination [who are assumed to be only partially protected by vaccination] and, no deaths among people where the illness onset occurred 10 days or more after they were vaccinated [who are assumed to be protected by vaccination],” the report said.

The data were posted on the WHO’s website following a meeting of a panel of experts asked to advise Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on whether the outbreak in the DRC should be declared a public health emergency of international concern. The committee concluded that the epidemic, though increasingly serious, does not constitute a global threat at this time.

The outbreak, which was first recognized last August, is the second largest on record. As of Thursday there have been 1,206 cases and 764 deaths. Nearly 98,000 doses of vaccine have been administered over the past eight months.

The WHO has been under pressure to release data on the vaccine’s effectiveness. Osterholm said it was critical that the agency share what it is finding.

“I think it’s very important because it helps give the world a better sense of how effective this vaccine is. And that the real challenges are not about ‘Does the vaccine work?’ It’s whether the vaccine gets used,” he said.

“The problem is not because you have an inferior vaccine response. Frankly this is outstanding. The challenge is getting it into people.”

Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s health emergencies program, agreed, saying the recent spike in cases in this outbreak was the result of the outbreak response team’s inability to vaccinate more people at the current hot spots of Katwa and Butembo, because many parts of those cities have been too dangerous for vaccination teams to operate in of late.

“We fell behind,” Ryan said in an interview. “And we’re paying the price for that now with increased transmission.”

The vaccine, which is being developed by Merck, is being used in what is known as a ring vaccination strategy. People who have had close and high-risk contact with known Ebola cases are offered vaccine. The contacts of those contacts are also offered a chance to be vaccinated. The aim is to throw up a wall of protection, cutting off the virus’s ability to spread.

People at high risk of exposure because of their jobs — health workers, ambulance drivers and people who man the safe burial teams — are also offered vaccine.

While the vaccine is still unlicensed, a clinical trial conducted in Guinea near the end of the West African Ebola outbreak showed the vaccine was highly efficacious. Based on that study, the WHO’s vaccine advisory committee has recommended that the vaccine be used as part of the arsenal of tools deployed to quell outbreaks.

The latest data reaffirm the findings of the trial in Guinea — though the report noted that this is an observational study, which is a limitation of this type of research.

The gold standard of trials involves randomly assigning some people to receive the vaccine and others to receive a placebo injection and comparing the infection rates in the two groups. But as this vaccine has been determined to be effective, it would be unethical to offer placebo injections rather than the vaccine."

And in new developments today, the country's health ministry reported 13 new cases and said the number of people vaccinated topped the 100,000 mark.

Baby, mom, health worker among fatalities

In its daily updates the DRC's health ministry reported 20 cases on Apr 23, 11 cases yesterday, and 13 cases today. All are from the current hot spots, with Katwa by far the hardest hit, with 30 infections. The other cases were reported in Mandima (4), Beni (2), Vuhovi (2), Butembo (2), Mabalako (2), Musienene (1), and Oicha (1). Health officials are still investigating 231 suspected cases.

The gush of new infections pushes the DRC's Ebola total to 1,264 cases, 1,198 of them confirmed and 66 listed as probable.

The death toll from the disease also shot higher, with 42 more fatalities reported, including a stillborn baby in Beni whose mother died at the Ebola treatment center.

Also, one of the people who died is a health worker in Katwa, an unvaccinated nurse who had contact with a confirmed patient and hid at home when her symptoms began where she received care from her coworkers. Her infection lifts the number of infected health workers to 89, including 32 deaths.

Of the latest fatalities, 24 people died from their infections in the community and 18 died at Ebola treatment centers. The total deaths in outbreak have now topped 800, reaching 814.

The health ministry also shared new details in light of pushing past the 100,000 vaccination mark, noting that 27,766 of those immunized are frontline health workers, 26,328 are high-risk contacts of confirmed cases, and 46,376 are contacts.

Officials also said the surge in new cases in Butembo and Katwa is partly explained by the temporary pause in vaccination activities surrounding March violence against the treatment center. The vaccination hiatus prevented 45 vaccination rings from opening around confirmed cases.

Powerful vaccine impact, 97.5% efficacy

The DRC's health ministry on Saturday said preliminary results from the clinical trial under way alongside the ring vaccination in the outbreak region confirm earlier high efficacy observations seen in Guinea's outbreak in 2015.

The DRC's national research institute (INRB) and the World Health Organization (WHO) analyzed data collected from May 1, 2018, to Mar 25, which revealed a vaccine efficacy estimate of 97.5% (95% confidence interval, 95.8% to 98.5%) for Merck's as-yet unlicensed VSV-EBOV vaccine.

Researchers looked at data from 93,965 people in 679 rings and 28,888 healthcare or frontline workers who were vaccinated. Only 71 of the vaccinated people got sick with Ebola, compared with 880 people during the same period who weren't vaccinated.

Of the 71 vaccinated people who became ill, 15 had symptoms beginning 10 or more days after vaccination, a period when vaccinees are thought to protect. Fifty-seven people had symptoms that began 0 to 9 days after vaccination, an interval when no protection or partial protection is thought to be in place.

The group's estimate for healthcare workers was also high, at 97.5%, though they weren't able to gauge the number of unvaccinated workers.

Also, the team looked at VSV-EBOV's impact on deaths from Ebola, which also found high efficacy. There were 9 deaths among 56 people who became ill during the partial protection interval, and no deaths in people whose symptoms began 10 or more days after vaccination, when protection is likely.

When the investigators examined illness patterns within the rings, they found that only two contacts of contacts got sick with Ebola, affirming that the ring vaccination strategy is highly efficient.

Take-home messages from the findings are that evidence is increasing on the efficacy of the vaccine and that even those who may have already been exposed to the virus at the time of vaccination may have greater chances of survival. ""This is a particularly important finding if we consider that there are no licensed treatments for Ebola, although investigational therapeutics are being used,"" the group wrote.

In a separate development, the DRC's health ministry reported nine new infections today, part of an ongoing surge of cases.

Novel strain triggered earlier outbreak

Most notably, the DRC has used in-country genomics to provide real-time analysis of the virus. In 2018, the DRC played host to its 9th and 10th Ebola outbreaks, drastically different in size and scope.

The newly published studies prove the virus strain responsible for the current outbreak, the world's second largest, is genetically different from a smaller outbreak in the western reaches of the DRC that ended in July of 2018.

From the earlier outbreak, which involved 54 cases, Placide Mbala-Kingebeni, MD, and colleagues sequenced 16 Ebola virus (EBOV) genomes to identify the novel strain, named ""Tumba."" That outbreak had a case-fatality rate of 60%, similar to the West African outbreak. The Tumba strain of the virus, however, was not as susceptible to current Ebola treatments.

""We show the feasibility of using genomics to rapidly characterise a new Ebola virus variant within the timeframe of an outbreak,"" concludes the authors of the study.

A second study, also authored by Mbala-Kingebeni and colleagues, focused on the coding of two Ebola virus genomes collected 5 days after the current outbreak, in the DRC's North Kivu and Ituri provinces, broke out. The current outbreak has a case-fatality rate of 62%, the highest of any documented Ebola outbreak.

The authors determined that this outbreak was not caused by the Tumba strain of Ebola virus, and was more susceptible to monoclonal antibody therapeutics (mAb114 and ZMapp), which are currently being used as treatment options.

Writing in a commentary on that study, a group led by Anise Happi, PhD, of the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, said the work supports the establishments of national and regional hubs of infectious diseases genomics in regions with a high risk of outbreaks ""where untargeted metagenomic sequencing analysis would be done. Thus, providing a potential one-step solution for outbreak pathogen detection of both known and novel pathogens would replace the need for multiple individual pathogen assays.""

Outbreak grows to 1,273 cases



According to the ministry of health's daily update, the DRC today confirmed 9 new cases, including 3 each in hotspots Katwa and Butembo, and one each in Masereka, Mandima, and Kyondo, raising the cumulative outbreak total to 1,273 cases, including 821 deaths. Seven deaths of confirmed cases were noted today, including four community deaths.

The DRC also updated its epidemiologic assessment of the outbreak, focusing on the week that began on Apr 8. Since then, 54.5% of all newly confirmed 110 cases came from Katwa.

""The number of new confirmed cases notified weekly has increased significantly in the last 5 weeks following targeted attacks against the Katwa and Butembo CTEs"" the ministry of health said.

Of the 83 deaths recorded last week, 49 were community deaths, or 59%, and 34 occurred in a treatment facility.

Vaccination efforts continue, with 101,249 people vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV, including 26,316 in Katwa, 22,059 in Beni, 12,447 in Butembo, and 6,556 in Mabalako.

Today Felix Tshisekedi, the president of the DRC, visited an Ebola treatment center in Beni, and made a speech calling on the local community to work with outbreak response workers.

Mistrust of first responders and widespread misinformation propagated by some community leaders has led many in affected areas of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo to refuse vaccinations. Instead, they turn to traditional healers, whose clinics have contributed to the hemorrhagic fever’s spread.

“It is not an imaginary disease,” Tshisekedi said after arriving in the city of Beni on his first tour of eastern Congo since being inaugurated in January.

“If we follow the instructions, in two or three months Ebola will be finished,” he optimistically told a crowd after having his temperature taken and washing his hands, as required of all incoming passengers to Beni airport.

Congo has suffered 10 outbreaks of Ebola, which causes severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding, since the virus was discovered there in 1976. The current one has seen 1,264 confirmed and probable cases and 814 deaths since it was declared last August.

It is surpassed only by the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa, in which more than 28,000 cases were reported and more than 11,000 people died.

Following a series of attacks on treatment centers by unidentified assailants in February and March, the current outbreak is now spreading at its fastest rate yet.

More than 100 cases were confirmed last week.

Tshisekedi, who won a disputed election last December to succeed Joseph Kabila, also called on Tuesday for the disarmament of dozens of militia that operate in the east and whose presence has complicated the Ebola response.

“The time of armed groups is over,” he said. “The new government is reaching out to these children of the country to surrender arms through disarmament programmes.”",no result found

All 17 of the newly confirmed cases are from the current epicenters: Katwa (11), Butembo (4), and Mandima (2), according to the health ministry's daily report. The flurry of new cases moved the outbreak total to 1,290, which includes 1,224 confirmed and 66 probable cases. Also, health officials are still investigating 251 suspected cases.

Twelve more people died from Ebola, 10 of them in their communities in Katwa, Mandima, and Butembo, exposing family members and neighbors to the virus. Two deaths occurred at Butembo's Ebola treatment center. Outbreak deaths have now reached 833.

The surge of cases in the DRC over the past few weeks has triggered panic in Katwa and Butembo, the health ministry said. However, it added that officials see some glimmers of optimism, such as an easing of resistance in some of the most inaccessible areas of the city, such as Mutsanga and Wayene.

""Although the rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in recent weeks may be worrying, the epidemic is actually concentrated in some well-defined health areas and there has been no geographical spread of the virus,"" it said, noting the main hot spots are Katwa, Vuhovi, Masereka, and Mandima. ""The epidemic has just resumed in areas that had already been affected because of patient mobility.""

In other response developments, the health ministry said customary chiefs from the Beni-Lubero area who took part in a national traditional chiefs meeting in Butembo sent a message to their local people and recommendations to outbreak responders, which focuses on stopping Ebola at the homefront. The youth council in Lubero has also launched a campaign to enlist young people in helping stem the spread of Ebola in people's homes.

They asked community members to distance themselves from anyone who minimizes Ebola and to accept that the disease is real. They also asked mothers and girls—who typically care for sick people at home—to avoid throwing rocks at the response teams.

Also, two national deputies from Ituri province went on a 3-day mission to Biakato in Mandima health zone, a town that has experienced an increase in confirmed Ebola cases in recent weeks, because response teams haven't been able to access sick patients due to community reluctance. They wrapped up their visit with a rally on Apr 14, where they reiterated prevention steps to stop the spread of the virus.

Sick doctor with more than 500 contacts

In its weekly situation report yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week's continuing rise in activity totaled 110 new cases, but it noted that transmission is still confined, mostly to Katwa, Mandima, Butembo, and Vuhovi.

Four more health workers are among the new cases, all from community health centers in the hot spots. Since the outbreak began, the virus sickened 89 health workers, 32 of them fatally.

One of the patients is a medical doctor from Beni, who generated 534 contacts.

In other developments, outbreak partners including the International Organization for Migrationand the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hosted a workshop to develop a plan to reinforce screening at the airport in Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.

The 33-year-old mother of six can spend entire days with patients at a treatment center in the North Kivu town of Beni, offering a comforting presence among a crowd of faceless figures with names written on their suits in marker pen.

Masika is one of dozens of survivors who are providing care - and much-needed human contact - to some of the littlest victims of the second-worst Ebola epidemic on record.

Of the more than 1,260 confirmed and probable Ebola cases, 28% are children, according to figures from the World Health Organization. More than 800 people, including at least 248 under the age of 18, have died since the outbreak began in August.

The outbreak is surpassed only by one in West Africa in 2013-16, which is believed to have killed more than 11,000 people.

FIGHTING BACK

Masika lost 10 relatives to the virus; four of those infected in her family survived.

“It was as if Ebola had chosen my family,” she said.

She was admitted to the same treatment center where she now works in September and stayed there for 21 days, battling horrific symptoms.

“It’s like suffering from all the diseases of Congo at the same time,” she said. “I felt bad all over my body: headache, stomach ache, diarrhea, vomiting, tiredness.”

Masika’s experience inspired her to join the fight against Ebola, comforting sick and frightened children who have to be isolated from their families and familiar surroundings to avoid infecting others. She is one of at least 23 former patients employed at the center in Beni, which is run by the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA).

When Reuters visited in late March, Masika was spending most of her time in a clear plastic isolation cube. She rocked and fanned Furaha, a little girl who rarely stirred or cried. The cubes allow patients to see relatives during treatment, albeit through thick plastic walls.

When the needle attached to Furaha’s intravenous drip had to be replaced, Masika gently lifted the girl and carried her to the back of the cube so a medic in full protective gear could find a new vein. Furaha slipped a skinny arm around Masika’s neck and leaned her head against the woman for support.

“My goal is to make her happy,” Masika said of her small charge, the youngest of five family members who were being treated at the center. “I treat the child like she’s my own, so she’s at ease even while she’s away from her parents.”

A few cubes down, the body of a 2-year-old boy who had died in the night lay on a bed, his thin frame barely making a bump under the flowered sheet that had been pulled up over his face.

‘KEEPING LOVE ALIVE’

Children are especially vulnerable to the virus because their bodies are less able to cope with the extreme fluid loss caused by diarrhea, vomiting, fever and bleeding, doctors say.

More than two out of every three children sickened in this outbreak have died, according to WHO figures. Others were orphaned or left on their own when their parents went into treatment.

Claudine Kitsa, 40, had to place a child in care while she was being treated for Ebola in the nearby trading hub of Butembo. She now does shifts at a childcare facility operated by the United Nations children’s agency UNICEF, taking turns with other survivors to sleep next to the babies’ cots on mosquito-netted beds.

On a recent morning, she strolled around a yard of hard-packed earth, rocking 7-month-old Christvie in her arms. Baby clothes were hung up to dry on the fence of the single-story compound, which had been freshly decorated in cartoon murals.

Christvie’s mother had recently died of Ebola, and staff were closely monitoring the baby to see if she would fall sick.

For Kitsa, volunteering at the center is a “way of keeping love alive,” at a time when Ebola is robbing families of the ability to care for their loved ones.

Healthcare workers say people like her play an invaluable role.

“We can’t be caring for children all of the time, because you can only wear PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) for one hour at a time. And it would scare … children,” said Trish Newport, the Ebola representative for Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) in Congo’s eastern city of Goma.

“So to have survivors who can wear light protection and be with the children and bond with them, it’s huge for us. We couldn’t manage without them.”

She believes that survivors benefit from the experience as well.

“There’s a lot of stigmatization for them in the community,” she said. But at the treatment centers, they are treated like heroes.

Survivors also serve as educators and advocates for the centers in the community.

AFRAID TO SEEK HELP

This is Congo’s 10th Ebola outbreak, but it is the first in the densely forested volcanic hillside provinces of North Kivu and Ituri.

Many are afraid to seek help from the experts. Some believe the disease is part of a plot by foreign aid agencies to make money, others that Congo’s former government was trying to kill off opposition supporters ahead of a December election.

It is one of the reasons this outbreak has been so difficult to contain, along with bouts of militia violence that send patients fleeing to other areas. Twenty new cases were reported Thursday and again on Saturday, the highest daily tolls since the outbreak began.

In the midst of tragedy and fear, children’s reunions with parents are a rare bright spot.

Godalive Kabuo, 30, smiled as she returned to the childcare center in Butembo to pick up her 6-month-old daughter, Hortense, a giggly baby in a yellow knit hat. Kabuo had just been discharged from the treatment center next door after testing negative for Ebola.

“Since they are taking care of the babies 100 percent, I say thank you,” she said.

Back in Beni, Masika whispered goodbye to Furaha at the end of her shift and handed her over to another caregiver. She then left the cube to disinfect herself with a chlorine solution and change back into regular clothes.

But the day was not yet over.

Walking purposefully out of the center, she said she was headed to a hospital. One of her own children was sick with malaria and needed her care.",no result found
18-Apr-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The incidence of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued to increase this week; however, it remained confined to a limited geographical area within North Kivu and Ituri provinces. This recent trend is likely attributable, in part, to past and ongoing security issues, unrest amongst certain local populations, and lingering community mistrust towards outbreak response teams. Improved case detection and response activities have been observed in previously inaccessible hotspots.

In the 21 days between 27 March and 16 April 2019, 55 health areas within 11 health zones reported new cases; 39% of the 143 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 249 confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (124), Vuhovi (40), Mandima (28), Butembo (24), Beni (16), Oicha (6), Mabalako (5), Kalunguta (2), Masereka (2), Musienene (1), and Lubero (1).

As of 16 April, a total of 1290 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 833 died (case fatality rate 65%). Of the 1290 cases with reported age and sex, 56% (725) were female, and 28% (361) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 89 (7% of total cases), including 32 deaths. To date, a total of 379 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged.

On 12 April 2019, the International Health Regulation (IHR) Emergency Committee convened in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss whether the EVD outbreak posed a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and offer response recommendations. While the Emergency Committee and the WHO Director-General reiterated their serious concern at the recent rise in the number of cases and the high risk of regional spread, upon consultation with various technical experts and further review of available epidemiological data, it was concluded that the current outbreak did not constitute a PHEIC. For the complete WHO statement concerning the 12 April IHR Emergency Committee meeting, please see here.

The ongoing vaccination efforts have produced some promising results this past week. On 12 April 2019, WHO and Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) published a preliminary analysis concerning the efficacy of the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine currently utilised in this outbreak (please see full report here). The data suggested the vaccine demonstrated notable efficacy in preventing Ebola infections in vaccinated individuals compared to those who are unvaccinated. Between 2-4 April 2019, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) convened a meeting to review the epidemiological data and offer further recommendations to the ongoing vaccination efforts. They urged the further expansion of those eligible for vaccination to include children older than 6 months and lactating women; two populations observed to have especially high attack rates and high case fatality rates (please see here for further highlights from the SAGE meeting).

In light of the findings, WHO and partners are evolving the existing vaccination strategy on the ground. Along with intensifying contact tracing of cases and vaccinating their known immediate contacts, a greater emphasis is being placed on following up contacts of contacts and ensuring these at-risk individuals are adequately vaccinated against Ebola. Various approaches are being employed at this time to vaccinate people at-risk including:

Site-by-site vaccinations at the places of residence and other locations previously visited by cases

Simultaneous vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers (HCW/FLW), and others at increased risk working in healthcare facilities

Pop-up vaccination, where those at risk are invited to an agreed upon location, outside their place of residence

Targeted geographic vaccination of villages if contacts, and contacts of contacts, cannot be clearly ascertained due to security constraints, but are invited to a previously agreed upon site to be vaccinated.

Through these strategies, 23 operational vaccination teams have effectively closed previously observed gaps in the vaccination rings surrounding reported cases; rings are currently pending for 10 of the 257 cases confirmed during the period between 28 March to 16 April 2019. As of 16 April, a total of 102 501 contacts and contacts of contacts have been vaccinated, of whom 29 720 were HCWs/FLWs. Outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, vaccination of frontline healthcare workers commenced in neighbouring Rwanda on 16 April 2019, with 176 HCWs/FLWs already vaccinated. It is expected that the vaccination strategy will be an effective means to slowing the spread of EVD.

Infection prevention and control (IPC) efforts have also yielded some notable progress this past week. A revised IPC strategy with an operational work plan for February to May 2019 period has been endorsed by the Ministry of Health (MoH). The strategy and work plan are intended to guide the national coordination activities of the Ebola response’s IPC Task Force, and the implementation of activities by the IPC commissions and partners at the subnational level. To support this operational shift, Risk Communication and Community Engagement research initiatives are being developed to better understand transmission pathways that can be addressed by the IPC coordination activities. Additional support will be provided by collecting feedback through community dialogue on how IPC can be better implemented at the community level.

While the EVD outbreak remains ongoing and the rise in number of cases is likely to continue in the following weeks, it should be noted that substantial progress has been made to adapt response strategies to the ever-evolving situation. Despite the multitude of challenges posed by having to mount a robust outbreak response in the demanding circumstances in which this EVD outbreak is currently taking place, WHO and partners are continuing to intensify all facets of the response efforts to curtail the further spread of EVD in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community reluctance, refusal, and resistance due to mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries, including vaccination of HCW and FLWs at prioritised health facilities, have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigated local spread; this must continue to be scaled-up.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

The cases raise the outbreak total to 1,302.

Of the 1,302 cases, 1,236 are confirmed and 66 are probable. The ministry said the death toll has now reached 843. A total of 325 suspected cases are still under investigation.

Of the 12 new cases 5 are in Katwa, 3 in Mandima, 2 in Vuhovi, and 1 each in Kalunguta and Beni. Ten deaths have also been recorded, including seven community deaths. Community deaths raise the risk of transmission to case contacts, including funeral attendees.

The DRC also said the ring vaccination campaign with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV continues, with 102,505 people vaccinated since Aug 8, including 27,022 in Katwa, 22,289 in Beni, and 12,468 in Butembo.

In its fourth rapid risk assessment released during this outbreak, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said there is still ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission in both urban and rural settings.

""More EVD cases are expected in the coming weeks and a wider geographical extension is still possible given the prolonged humanitarian crisis in the region,"" the ECDC said, noting that since mid-March, weekly case counts have increased to 52 to 73 cases per week.

Despite the ongoing transmission, the ECDC said the risk of spread to the European Union remains low.

Travel advice for US health workers

Earlier this week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations for all US-based healthcare and emergency response workers traveling to and from the outbreak region, including a pre-departure assessment for symptoms of the virus for any workers traveling from Ebola outbreak areas to the United States.

The CDC suggests that all people traveling to an Ebola outbreak zone understand the importance of self-monitoring for fever and symptoms 21 days after leaving the outbreak region.

Of note, the CDC said workers may opt to receive the Ebola vaccine as part of ongoing studies based at the National Institutes of Health. Employees should also be up-to-date on all travel vaccinations, and have access to personal protective equipment during their stay.

The three died in clashes on Tuesday in Bovata, near the town of Beni, a source at the U.N. peacekeeping mission and a civil society leader told Reuters. The town and the surrounding area have been simultaneously beset by militia violence and an Ebola epidemic.

It was not possible to independently verify Islamic State’s claim, made through its Amaq news agency. There are more than a dozen different militia groups and criminal outfits operating in this area of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. IS also claimed a higher toll of five soldiers killed and three wounded.

Meanwhile, in an ongoing gush of cases following response delays from the earlier attacks, 15 more infections were confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) today, putting the outbreak total at 1,317.

According to a DRC media report, the unidentified attackers struck clinics at Catholic University of Graben, killing a foreign doctor, burning a truck carrying health workers, and causing other damage. The clinics house an Ebola triage response team.

WHO epidemiologist dead

As news of the attack filtered in, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said he was deeply concerned for patients, health ministry, WHO, and partner staff. On Twitter, he said, ""This is a very sad day. We just learned of one fatality, as well as some people injured, in the attack on hospital in Butembo.""

As more details came in, Tedros added that the man who died is a WHO epidemiologist deployed to the outbreak region, Dr Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung. ""We grieve together with his family during this difficult time,"" he added.

In a statement today, the WHO said two other people were injured in the attack, but are believed to be in stable condition. It said the attack occurred during a coordination meeting being held at the hospital.

The WHO is assessing the security situation to ensure the safety of patients, health workers, and Ebola responders, Tedros said, adding that the WHO remains committed to supporting the health ministry and ending the outbreak as quickly as possible.

Also weighing in on the attack, DRC health minister Oly Ilunga, MD, said on Twitter that national and international health officers show courage and exceptional self-sacrifice to protect the DRC against Ebola, ""sometimes at the cost of their lives.""

Butembo's deputy mayor Patrick Kambale Tsiko said the militia group responsible for the attack wrongly believes foreigners brought Ebola virus to the DRC and have threatened that attacks will continue until the outsiders leave, the Associated Press (AP) reported today.

Three assailants from a local self-defense militia attacked the hospital in the city of Butembo, one of the epicenters of the second-largest Ebola epidemic in history, said Patrick Kambale, the city’s deputy mayor.

The outbreak is now spreading at its fastest rate since being declared last August, due largely to a spate of attacks by militiamen and others distrustful of the international response.

“The assailants are identified as Mai-Mai rebels demanding the departure of the international community engaged in the Ebola response,” Kambale told Reuters.

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus identified the doctor killed as Richard Mouzoko, a senior epidemiologist from Cameroon.

“The @WHO family lost a dear colleague in the hospital attack in Butembo, #DRC, today,” Tedros wrote on Twitter. “We are outraged by the attack. Health workers are #NotATarget.”

The totals swell outbreak numbers to 1,340 cases, of which 1,274 are confirmed. The number of deaths rose to 874.

Katwa hospital attack

The Katwa attack came 1 day after a hospital attack in Butembo took the life of a World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiologist deployed to the outbreak region. Both Katwa and Butembo have been hot spots of virus activity in the last several months—more than half of all cases reported in recent weeks originated in Katwa.

According to officials, the attack in Katwa took place around 3 a.m. local time on Apr 20 at the sub-coordination office located at the Katwa Reference General Hospital. Police controlled the attack, and three assailants were wounded in addition to the assailant that the police killed.

The attacks are another challenge to response efforts in the region, which have been hindered by community resistance and earlier violent attacks.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, tweeted the same day about the most recent attack.

""Appalled by another attack on health workers saving lives in DRC. The violence not only disrupts vital Ebola outbreak response but also creates risk of disease spread. Latest attack was 24 hours after Butembo and @WHO colleague's death,"" he said.

Eight new community deaths

Eight of the 19 deaths recorded since Apr 20 took place in the community, which raises the risk of further disease spread as family members and funeral attendees may have been exposed to the virus if an unsafe burial took place.

One of the community deaths described yesterday occurred in a 10-month old child from Beni, who died shortly after arriving in an Ebola treatment facility. The health ministry said patients who die within 24 hours of arriving at a treatment facility are classified as a community death.

As of today, the DRC said 105 suspected cases are still under investigation.

Ring vaccination with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine continues, with 104,544 people vaccinated since Aug 8 of last year. This includes 28,056 in Katwa, 22,777 in Beni, 12,656 in Butembo, 6,740 in Mabalako, and 4,433 in Mandima.

Diagnostic stewardship intervention reduces inappropriate use of GI test

Implementing a ""hard stop"" in a hospital's electronic medical record system significantly reduced inappropriate use of a rapid diagnostic test for gastrointestinal pathogens and saved more than $160,000 over 15 months, researchers from the University of Nebraska Medical Center report today in Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology.

In a quasi-experimental study conducted at an 830-bed tertiary care medical center, the researchers measured the impact of a diagnostic stewardship intervention on the use of the FilmArray Gastrointestinal Panel (GIPP), a rapid multiplex panel that can detect 22 common pathogens in patients who have diarrhea.

The hospital has used the GIPP since 2015 in lieu of traditional stool culture, but concerns about inappropriate use led to an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) intervention that included updated guidelines on appropriate use and an order validation alert in the electronic medical record. The alert appears when users attempt to order the GIPP more than once per admission or in patients hospitalized more than 72 hours, and an override requires clinicians to call the microbiology lab director.

A comparison of the preintervention period (January 2016 through March 2017) and the postintervention period (April 2017 though March 2018) showed that the rate of GIPP test ordering dropped from 7.48 per 1,000 patient-days to 5.24 per 1,000 patient-days. The Poisson model estimated a 30% reduction in GIPP ordering rates between the two periods (relative risk, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.78, P < .001). Furthermore, the rate of inappropriate tests ordered declined from 21.5% to 4.9% (P < .001). When including encounters in which the GIPP was initiated but not completed, testing was reduced by 46%, for a potential savings of $168,000.

The authors of the study conclude, ""Responsible test ordering of low-yield tests such as the GIPP leads to significant cost savings without affecting high-quality patient care. This study and our results highlight the value of diagnostic stewardship in ASP and collaboration with the microbiology laboratory.""

New polio cases recorded in Pakistan as policeman killed in Bannu

Today officials in Pakistan recorded two more polio cases, one in North Waziristan and the other in Bannu, as a policeman in Bannu protecting vaccination efforts was gunned down.

According to media reports, the attack on the policeman was linked to a personal grudge, and not a statement on vaccination efforts.

The two new cases raise Pakistan's polio case counts for 2019 to eight. The wild poliovirus infections occurred in a 2-year-old girl from North Waziristan, and a 22-month-old boy from Bannu. Health officials said the children's parents were responsible for the cases, implying they had refused vaccination.

Pakistan has currently suspended a vaccine campaign after several protests and demonstrations overwhelmed local hospitals and vaccinators.

According to a study today in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, a third dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine illicit a good immune response and was safe in healthy adult volunteers.

Waning protection from the two doses of MMR most people get in childhood is likely a culprit in adults' susceptibility to mumps. In this study, researchers in the Netherlands gave a third dose of the MMR vaccine (MMR-3) to 150 volunteers ages 18 to 25, who had no history of mumps and had received two MMR doses in childhood. Blood samples were collected at the time of MMR injection, and 1 month and 1 year after.

No serious adverse outcomes were reported, though 12% of participates reported localized pain at the injection site. Thirty-three percent of the participants reported one or more systemic adverse events, including the swelling of neck glands (16%) or joint and muscle pain (18%), the authors said.

The authors said 77.6% of the study group was estimated to be protected against mumps virus infection prior to vaccination, based on antibody titer levels, which increased to 85.7% and 85.8%, respectively, at 4 weeks and 1 year following vaccination.

""According to the defined cutoff levels that were determined based on pre-outbreak sera, approximately 20% of the young adults in our study was expected to be susceptible for mumps virus infection prior to MMR-3 receipt,"" the authors concluded. ""Our data support that MMR-3 vaccination is a good and safe manner to control a mumps outbreak.""

MERS diagnosis delay linked to patient, health-system delays

Both patient delays in seeking medical care and health-system delays contributed to the diagnostic delay of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus). The findings are published in the Journal of Infection and Public Health.

The study was based on medical records of 266 MERS patients, reported by the WHO from January 2017 through May 2018. The patients were mostly men (71.8%), and 94% were from Saudi Arabia, with 30.5% directly exposed to camels.

The authors found the median diagnostic delays, patient delays, and health-system delays were 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3-8 days), 4 days (IQR, 2-7 days), and 2 days (IQR, 1-2 days), with both patient and health-system delays positively correlated with a diagnostic delay.

Diagnostic delays contribute to nosocomial MERS outbreaks, the authors write.

""Early MERS-CoV diagnosis remains a major challenge and may require more sensitive risk assessment tools to reduce avoidable delays, specifically those related to patients and health system,"" they concluded.

Food shortages are longstanding problem in the central African country, where about 13 million people, or 15 percent of the population, did not have enough to eat last year, according to the international food security tracking system IPC.

Public mistrust is a major obstacle to stopping the epidemic, which has infected more than 1,300 people and killed 880 in eastern Congo since July, with many refusing vaccines and resisting treatment, while medical centers have been attacked.

“People receiving food are found to be more willing to cooperate in registration, vaccination and treatment,” said Claude Jibidar, the World Food Programme’s country director.

Delivering food to families that might have been exposed to Ebola also helps prevent the disease’s spread by keeping people at home instead of in markets and public places, he said.

The world’s worst epidemic of Ebola, a hemorrhagic fever, killed more than 11,300 people in West Africa from 2013 to 2016.

Congo’s Ebola outbreak is spreading at its fastest rate yet, with a record number of new cases in recent weeks as militia violence and community suspicion have impeded access, with many deaths occurring outside of treatment centers.

Providing greater support for people affected by violence in the area - where about one million are displaced due to years of conflict - could make them more willing to seek Ebola services, said Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) charity.

“It is very unlikely for somebody who is without shelter, without food, without education for their children ... to run and go get treatment when their basic needs were never addressed,” said Kimberly Bennett, a spokeswoman for NRC.

Worsening violence and poor rains have contributed to a rise in hunger in parts of North Kivu province - one of the areas hard-hit by Ebola - said the NRC, particularly among displaced families and those hosting them.

People infected or suspected of Ebola infection have also been forced to abandon their work when they are quarantined to prevent transmission of the disease, it said.",no result found
25-Apr-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

This past week witnessed a notable escalation of security incidents surrounding the Ebola virus disease (EVD) response efforts. On 19 April, an attack on a hospital in Katwa by armed militia resulted in the tragic death of Dr Richard Mouzoko Kiboung, a WHO epidemiologist, and the injury of two other healthcare workers. To ensure the safety of all outbreak responders, Ebola response activities have been temporarily halted in some high-risk health areas until security measures can be reinforced.

WHO, the UN, and the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are actively collaborating to review current strategic and operational security measures to ensure the protection of healthcare workers in the field, and improve effective coordination and information sharing amongst all security elements covering the response. Existing operational security measures continue to be implemented and strengthened as well, including the establishment of security perimeters around the residences of EVD response personnel, increasing security at fixed locations, enhancing the joint quick response team (QRT) capacities of local police and UN security forces, and ensuring staff compliance with tracking procedures and adherence to curfew. These measures and other security risk management processes will be continually updated to reflect the needs of the evolving security situation on the ground.

In addition to revising security measures, efforts in community outreach through direct dialogue with various community leaders are also being intensified. Since January, there has been a notable increase in community resistance incidents, primarily around Katwa and Butembo. Incidents in April are anticipated to reach or go beyond March levels. As gaining community understanding and acceptance is integral to our ability to mount an effective outbreak response, community engagement efforts remain a significant element of our response to alleviate future security risks to healthcare workers, develop and increase local community capacity to ensure continuity of response operations, and improve the overall security situation in EVD hotspot areas.

Incidence of EVD cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo this week saw a lull compared to the week prior (Figure 1). However, this observation should be interpreted with caution and in the context of the recent disruption to response activities and case reporting in certain hotspot areas. In the 21 days between 3 – 23 April 2019, 62 health areas within 11 health zones reported new cases; 42% of the 147 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 255 confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (132), Butembo (29), Vuhovi (29), Mandima (21), Beni (15), Mabalako (9), Kalunguta (6), Musienene (6), Masereka (5), Oicha (2), and Kyondo (1).

As of 23 April, a total of 1367 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 885 died (case fatality rate 65%). Of the total cases, 56% (765) were female, and 28% (386) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 90 (7% of total cases), including 33 deaths. To date, a total of 392 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community reluctance, refusal, and resistance due to mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries, including vaccination of HCW and FLWs at prioritised health facilities, have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigated local spread; this must continue to be scaled-up.

WHO advice

International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

1 Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning.",no result found,This weeks Ebola DON disease outbreak news from WHO makes for very worrying reading Ill likely be taken to t httpstcoChtTa0vNv0,"April has brought worsening conditions to the ongoing Ebola outbreak in North Kivu province, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), according to the latest disease outbreak news update from the World Health Organization (WHO), as cases continue to mount.

Both community resistance and violent attacks are on the rise in hot spots such as Katwa and Butembo, the WHO said, and a perceived lull in cases only reflects that surveillance activity has been interrupted due to ongoing security threats.

Efforts halted in some areas

""This past week witnessed a notable escalation of security incidents surrounding the Ebola virus disease (EVD) response efforts,"" the agency said.

The outbreak region saw two violent attacks on health centers treating Ebola patients, resulting in the death of one WHO epidemiologist, and the injury of two other health workers. Today officials in the DRC said 11 people suspected to have carried out the attack have been arrested.

""To ensure the safety of all outbreak responders, Ebola response activities have been temporarily halted in some high-risk health areas until security measures can be reinforced,"" the WHO said. In addition, the WHO said residences of response personnel will have strengthened security perimeters.

Yesterday, the Associated Press (AP) reported that some clinicians in the region are threatening to strike because of recent attacks. Yesterday in Butembo nurses and doctors dressed in white marched to city hall to give a memorandum to the mayor asking for more protection.

20 cases in past 2 days

Yesterday and today, the DRC recorded 20 new Ebola cases, including 10 death—5 that took place in the community, which raise the risk of disease spread.

The outbreak totals now stand at 1,373 cases, of which 1,307 are confirmed and 66 are probable. Officials have confirmed 890 deaths, and 248 suspected cases are still under investigation.

Overall, the outbreak has a 65% case-fatality rate. Of the total patients, 56% (765) are female, and 28% (386) are children. The total number of health workers infected in the outbreak has reached 90 (7% of all cases), including 33 deaths.

The WHO said that from Apr 3 to Apr 23, 255 confirmed cases were reported in Katwa (132), Butembo (29), Vuhovi (29), Mandima (21), Beni (15), Mabalako (9), Kalunguta (6), Musienene (6), Masereka (5), Oicha (2), and Kyondo (1).

Within those cases are, according to the WHO, a high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, a relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, and the existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection. These factors contribute to the ongoing nature of the outbreak.

The ring vaccination with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine continues, with 105,233 people vaccinated to date, including 28,146 in Katwa, 22,969 in Beni, and 12,696 in Butembo.

The surge of cases, which often happens after attacks on the Ebola response, puts the new outbreak total within striking distance of 1,400 cases, and today the fatality count reached 900.

The 23 new cases are from eight different locations, 9 of them in Katwa, one of the main epicenters and the scene of one of the recent violent episodes that stalled important response activities—including case finding and contact tracing—that are key steps in battling the outbreak. The other new cases are from Mandima (3), Musienene (2), Butembo (2), and one each in Kalunguta, Vuhovi, Komanda, and Mabalako.

Health officials are also investigating 260 suspected cases. The new cases announced by the DRC health ministry today boost the outbreak total to 1,396 cases, which includes 1,330 confirmed and 66 probable infections.

Ten more people died from their infections, putting the fatality count at 900. Eight of them died in their communities, a factor known to increase the risk of virus transmission, given that viral loads are highest during severe illness and at death and that those caring for loved ones in homes don't have personal protective equipment to protect against Ebola. Two of the deaths occurred at Katwa's Ebola treatment center.

The number of people vaccinated with the VSV-EBOV vaccine continues to rise, and since the campaign began in early August, 105,757 people have been immunized, more than half of them in the three main hot spots: Katwa, Beni, and Butembo.

Late last week, officials recorded 23 cases in one day, the previous high.

Deadliest day

In addition to the 27 cases recorded today, the ministry also recorded 26 deaths—also the highest daily total to date—15 of which took place in the community. Community deaths are linked to further virus transmission, as they can signal unsafe burial practices and contact with a patient's bodily fluids.

The cases and fatalities raise outbreak totals to 1,466 cases (1,400 confirmed and 66 probable) and 957 deaths. A total of 239 suspected cases are still under investigation.

The sobering numbers follow a weekend of increased virus activity. The ministry recorded 41 cases over the weekend and 31 new deaths, making this the most deadly series of days in this outbreak. The 3-day total of 70 cases is a record, as is the 3-day fatality total of 57.

Katwa and Butembo remain the outbreak hot spots, with Beni, Mandima, Musienene, Biena, Kalunguta, Mutwanga, and Mabalako also noting cases in the past few days.

And in a sign that some of these cases may be linked to nosocomial transmission, the DRC said over the weekend that three health workers were among newly confirmed cases in the last 2 weeks.

The cumulative number of confirmed cases or probable among health workers has now reached 92 (6.4% of all confirmed and probable cases), including 33 deaths.

Epidemic 'beyond public health'

Over the weekend Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, the minister of health in the DRC, held a meeting about Ebola for government leaders, including president-elect Felix Tshisekedi. Heads of finance, defense, and budget also attended the meeting.

""In his presentation, the Minister of Health insisted that, given the difficult security situation, this epidemic had gone beyond public health,"" the Apr 27 DRC update said. ""So far, the epidemic has been contained in two provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo, but in order to put an end to it, it is necessary to strengthen the multisectoral component of the response, and therefore the involvement of other ministries.""

The recent spike in cases follows two violent attacks—one deadly—on healthcare centers in Butembo and Katwa in recent weeks.

Throughout the outbreak, violent attacks have been followed by a rise in cases as surveillance and outbreak response is temporarily halted in the attack aftermath. Last week, doctors in the region threatened to strike if they were not offered more security.

In today's update, DRC officials highlighted a partnership among the health ministry, the World Health Organization, and two US universities to train local ophthalmologists and monitor Ebola survivors for eye problems, which can occur in nearly 20%.

""This is the first time that ophthalmic monitoring of survivors has been implemented so quickly after survivors have left Ebola treatment centers during an active epidemic,"" the health ministry said.

As of today, a ring vaccination campaign with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV continues in the outbreak region, with 107,565 people vaccinated, including 28,826 in Katwa, 21,107 in Beni, and 13,246 in Butembo.

The previous record was 110 confirmed cases a couple of weeks ago.

The outbreak in the country’s eastern regions is now spreading at its fastest rate, due largely to a spate of attacks by militiamen and others distrustful of the international response.

In the past two months, five Ebola centers have been attacked and a senior World Health Organization official was killed by militiamen 10 days ago.

The assailants have mostly been unidentified but are believed to comprise both local militiamen and community members who oppose the response efforts. Many believe that Ebola is a conspiracy cooked up by the government or foreign countries.

The current outbreak of the virus, which causes severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding, is the second largest in history behind the 2013-16 West African epidemic that killed more than 11,000 people.

Also today, African countries near the DRC met in Kampala today to review their Ebola preparedness steps and form new plans for preventing and responding to the possible arrival of the virus within their borders.

High-level visit airs profound worry

The visit from WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, and WHO Regional Director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti, MD, comes just 10 days after WHO epidemiologist Dr Richard Mouzoko was killed in an armed attack during his work on the Ebola outbreak.

In a statement, the two said they were profoundly worried about the situation and acknowledged that recent surges in infections are the result of setbacks each time the response sustains violent attacks.

Most of the response activities—such as community engagement, vaccination, and case investigation—have restarted following a slowdown after the attacks that killed Mouzoko and injured two others, the WHO said. It notes, however, that the torrent of cases in recent weeks is further straining resources.

Moeti said her pride and respect for the outbreak responders has grown. ""They have been through something unimaginable and yet are willing to continue this vital work. We need the security situation to be under control for them and for the local people.""

The group met with Butembo's mayor, US Ambassador Michael Hammer, a United Nations (UN) peacekeeping mission (MONUSCO) representative, and other partners, as well as local business, religious, and political leaders.

WHO officials also urged the international community to step up its support to contain the outbreak, including bridging funding gaps. Tedros said the response requires major shifts. ""WHO and partners cannot tackle these challenges without the international community stepping in to fill the sizeable funding gap."" He added that the WHO has received only half of the support it asked for, which could require health officials to scale back activities when they are needed most.

New cases boost total to 1,480

Meanwhile, in outbreak developments, the DRC health ministry reported 14 more cases today, including 6 in Katwa, 2 in Musienene, and 2 in Butembo. Also, four other locations each reported a single case: Mabalako, Beni, Kayna, and Kalunguta.

The newly confirmed cases lift the outbreak total to 1,480 cases, which includes 1,414 confirmed and 66 probable infections. Health officials are still investigating 279 suspected cases.

Thirteen more people died from Ebola, six in community or hospital settings across a broad swath of the current hot spots: Katwa, Musienene, Kayna, and Beni. Seven others died at Ebola treatment centers, including four in Butembo and three in Katwa. Total outbreak deaths have now climbed to 970.

In other outbreak developments, the ministry said that—based on a recent request from the DRC's president—the country's prime minister and Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, today signed a decree establishing and organizating a multisector committee for Ebola response. The committee's goal is to spell out new government steps to battle the outbreak, coordinate with different government levels, and help allocate resources for the response. It will meet weekly or more often, as needed.

Regional officials meet in Kampala

Also today, international partners working on Ebola preparedness and response began a 2-day meeting in Kampala, Uganda's capital, to discuss key risk factors and response challenges and to suggest new solutions.

In a press release from the WHO's Uganda office, Jane Ruth Aceng, MBChB, MPH, the country's health minister, said the increasing complexity of the outbreak in the two DRC provinces poses a risk of spread within the DRC and to its neighbors. ""This outbreak is therefore not a problem of the DRC alone,"" she said.

Comprising delegates from nine countries, the group is slated to share information on their Ebola preparedness strategies and share information on their challenges and best practices. At the end of the meeting, the group will develop a joint preparedness roadmap.

Among the experts' worries are infection prevention and control in health facilities and deaths that keep occurring in community settings, the WHO said.

However, the biggest concern is the fragile security situation in the DRC's affected areas. Presenters from the DRC said there are about 30 armed groups in the outbreak region, some of which have attacked Ebola treatment centers.

Officials said the DRC's neighbors have reason to worry, given long porous borders and frequent population movements.

April was the deadliest month of the 9-month long outbreak, which has been studded with acts of violence against response workers and discord between community members and health officials. In April, two attacks in Katwa and Butembo (current virus hot spots) significantly stalled outbreak surveillance and lowered the morale of clinicians in the region.

April total: 406 cases, 308 deaths

Today's cases raise the outbreak total to 1,495, of which 1,429 are confirmed and 66 are probable. There have been 984 deaths, and 306 suspected cases are still under investigation.

Among the fatalities recorded today, six were community deaths, which raise the risk of transmission. DRC officials confirmed 308 deaths in April alone.

According to US Centers for Disease control and Prevention (CDC) data, the 406 cases recorded in April—if considered by themselves—would constitute the third-largest Ebola outbreak in history, behind the West African outbreak in 2014 through 2016 (28,652 cases) and a 2000 outbreak in Uganda (425 cases).

As it stands, the current outbreak is the world's second largest, and the DRC's 10th since 1976, when the disease was first recorded.

Today the DRC said vaccination with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV continues, reaching 108,905 people, including almost 30,000 in Katwa. Preliminary data from the World Health Organization (WHO) released last month show the vaccine is 97.55% effective against the virus.

Award aims to accelerate response

Today the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation named the WHO, Red Cross, and UNICEF as recipients of the Ebola Response Accelerator Challenge, funding projects that aim to end this outbreak quickly, according to a Paul G. Allen news release.

In 2014, Paul G. Allen was the single largest private donor to the West Africa Ebola response, committing $100 million to contain the spread of the disease. Funding for the three projects announced today totals $2.4 million.

The Red Cross project will track community data for response workers, while the WHO's project aims to train Congolese medical students and youth leaders about Ebola.

The grant allows UNICEF to establish a new text message system.

""UNICEF and partners will be able to mobilize effective community engagement through U-Report, a free SMS social messaging tool that allows community members to speak out and engage with critical emergency issues. Together, this impactful partnership will continue to save lives and support healthier futures in the DRC,"" said Caryl M. Stern, president and CEO of UNICEF USA, in the press release.

2-May-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The operating environment has become increasingly insecure and socio-politically complex. Insecurity remains a major impediment to ensuring timely response interventions in the affected communities. Ebola virus disease (EVD) response activities in Butembo and Katwa remained limited; however, these are gradually resuming following a comprehensive reinforcement of security measures and community engagement efforts. The overall security situation, nevertheless, remains volatile. While no significant injuries or damages are reported this week, access and activities in parts of Mandima, Masereka, Kalunguta and Vuhovi, remain irregular due to the presence of armed groups and other security concerns. New EVD cases are expected to continue to increase, in tandem with incidents of insecurity in these hotspot areas over the coming weeks, placing significant strain on response teams and the security resources available to secure their movements.

Incidence of EVD cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo this week saw a considerable, although not unexpected, rise compared to the week prior. This observation is in line with previous instances where a disruption to response activities was followed by a spike in the number of new cases. Transmission remains most intense in the Katwa, Butembo, and Mandima hotspot areas (Figure 1 and Table 1). In addition, notable recurring re-introduction events having been documented in previously affected health zones such as Mabalako and Musienene, followed by local amplification and extension to affect new heath areas. In the 21 days between 10 – 30 April 2019, 70 health areas within 15 health zones reported new cases; 45% of the 157 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 292 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Katwa (47%, n=137), Butembo (13%, n=38), Mandima (11%, n=32), Mabalako (7%, n=20), and Musienene (6%, n=17).

As of 30 April, a total of 1495 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 984 died (case fatality rate 66%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 56% (830) were female, and 28% (422) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 92 (6% of total cases). To date, a total of 415 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been discharged.

From 27 to 30 April, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and WHO Regional Director for Africa Dr Matshidiso Moeti, visited Butembo to review current response activities and bolster support for the response personnel currently operating there. During the visit, Dr Tedros and Dr Moeti travelled to Butembo to express their gratitude and show support to WHO and partner organisation staff, while also assessing the next steps needed to strengthen both security and the Ebola response effort. They also met with local political, business and religious leaders, and called on them to accelerate their efforts to help stabilise the surrounding environment. The visit concluded with both Dr Tedros and Dr Moeti reiterating their concerns for the present situation and repeating their appeal to the international community to intensify support to contain the outbreak by bridging the funding gap.

Risk Communication & Community Engagement (RCCE) and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) teams have been collaborating in preparation for the launch of an IPC campaign due to commence on 5 May 2019, WHO World Hand Hygiene Day. The initial focus of this campaign is on Injection Safety, an initiative aimed at encouraging the greater use of oral medication over injectables and the safe use and handling of needles at healthcare facilities as a means of reducing EVD transmission risks. RCCE teams are also working closely with other WHO partners to bring about a new mass communication campaign in the coming weeks to promote key messages from all outbreak response pillars to the affected communities.

As part of the continued efforts to empower communities to be more actively engaged in the EVD response, requests received from the numerous dialogues with local residents are being reviewed to aid the transfer of some of the response ownership back to the community. Recent dialogues have focused on addressing community-related incidents of reluctance or mistrust. Some notable successes from this effort have resulted, including some previously resistant contacts coming forward to re-engage with response activities, and pledging to assist by utilising their influence in the community to encourage greater cooperation with EVD response teams.

Public health response

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigated local spread. However, these efforts must continue to be scaled-up at this time.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Reports from Nepal detail country's first H5N1 case

Media outlets from Nepal today, citing the country's health ministry, reported the country's first human H5N1 avian flu case, involving a 21-year-old man who apparently died from his infection.

The country has seen sporadic H5N1 outbreaks in poultry since March, most recently at a commercial duck farm in Bagmati zone, which surrounds Kathmandu. The Himalayan Times said the patient is from Kavrepalanchok district in the south central part of the country. He died on Mar 29, and tests the next day revealed H5N1. The samples have been sent to Japan for further testing, according to the report.

Nepal's case would mark the world's first confirmed H5N1 case since 2017. Since 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 860 human H5N1 cases, 454 of them fatal. Egypt, Indonesia, and Vietnam are among the hardest-hit countries.

FDA approves Dengvaxia, Sanofi's controversial dengue vaccine

Yesterday the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dengvaxia, the world's first dengue vaccine, for use in children ages 9 through 16 who have had at least one laboratory-confirmed previous dengue infection and live in endemic areas.

""As the second infection with dengue is often much more severe than the first, the FDA's approval of this vaccine will help protect people previously infected with dengue virus from subsequent development of dengue disease,"" said Peter Marks, MD, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a press release.

The list of caveats comes after Sanofi Pasteur's vaccine caused public outcry in the Philippines in 2017, when it was discovered the vaccine had been administered to dengue-naive schoolchildren. In some cases, the vaccine can act as a ""priming"" infection in dengue-naive recipients, making subsequent infections severe and life-threatening.

The World Health Organization has since recommended the vaccine be administered only to those with evidence of prior dengue infection.

Dengvaxia is a live-attenuated vaccine and contains genes of each of the four subtypes of dengue. Dengue is endemic in the US territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands.

Merck steps up MMR production in wake of US measles outbreaks

Merck, the sole provider of a measles vaccine in the United States, said it is stepping up production of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to meet the demands, but supplies have not yet been outpaced by the growing number of US cases.

According to a Reuters story, Merck said earlier this week that US sales of MMR and chickenpox vaccines rose around 10%, to $343 million in the first quarter.

As of Apr 26, the United States has recorded 704 measles cases, the most in any year since 1994, and the highest number recorded since the virus was eliminated in 2000.

The resurgence has been linked to vaccine hesitancy, close-knit communities, and international measles outbreaks, according to the latest measles report published this week in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWR).

""Among the 704 cases, 503 (71%) were in unvaccinated persons and 689 (98%) occurred in U.S. residents. Overall, 66 (9%) patients were hospitalized,"" the report said.

WHO: Republic of Congo sees more than 6,000 chikungunya cases

The Republic of the Congo in February declared a chikungunya outbreak, and cases have not topped 6,000, according to a WHO statement yesterday.

Since Jan 1, officials have reported 6,149 suspected cases of chikungunya in the country, with approximately 54% of reported cases being reported in women. The WHO warned, however, that the number of cases is likely underestimated.

""The scale of this outbreak has likely been underestimated given the limited detection capacity of the surveillance system in the country. Several mosquito breeding sites in affected areas and inadequate vector control mechanisms also represent major contributing factors for the outbreak,"" the WHO said.

So far, no deaths have been reported in any of the eight health departments reporting cases. This is the second chikungunya outbreak in the Congo since 2011, the WHO said, but no seasonal patterns have been detected.

May 1 WHO statement",no result found,no result found,"NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - People fleeing violence in an Ebola-hit region of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo are being forced to cross the border illegally into Uganda, risking the virus spreading into the neighboring East African nation, aid groups said on Friday.

More than 60,000 people in Democratic Republic of Congo’s (DRC) Beni region in North Kivu province have left their homes since the latest wave of armed attacks began on March 30.

While some have found legal refuge in Uganda, others are being used as human shields by armed groups who prevent them from reaching official border points to be registered, screened for Ebola and given sanctuary.

As a result, some displaced people are forced to cross illegally into Uganda - trekking through dense forests or taking boats across a shared lake - raising the risk of the virus spreading undetected.

“These unofficial crossings are placing people in search of refuge at an increased and totally unnecessary risks of sexual exploitation and abuse,” said Francis Iwa, executive director of Care for Forced Migrants (CAFOMI), a Kampala-based charity.

“Once they enter Uganda, they also are avoiding official immigration procedures and registration as refugees - which means they may not be screened for Ebola and will be unable to access the very services prepared to assist them.”

CAFOMI is one of 18 charities, including Oxfam, Action Against Hunger, Care, Catholic Relief Services, Norwegian Refugee Council and Save the Children, warning Congolese and Ugandan authorities of a potential humanitarian crisis.

Musa Ecweru, Uganda’s minister for disaster management and refugee affairs, said surveillance teams and authorities along the border were on red alert for suspected cases of Ebola.

“Uganda will continue to keep its doors open to refugees as this is our policy,” Ecweru told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Kampala.

“We must allow those people who need refuge to come to Uganda, but we must also be vigilant not to compromise the health of the people of our country.”

Congo’s Beni region has been at the epicenter of an Ebola outbreak since August. It has infected an estimated 1,495 people and killed 984 in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

The outbreak of the virus, which causes severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding, is the second largest behind the 2013-16 West African epidemic that killed more than 11,000 people.

Attacks by armed groups on civilians, Congolese soldiers and U.N. peacekeepers have hampered efforts to contain the epidemic.

Congolese officials blame rebels from a Ugandan Islamist group in the area for dozens of attacks that killed hundreds of civilians over the past five years.

Independent experts say other factions and Congolese soldiers are also responsible.

The charities said tens of thousands of displaced people were trapped between Uganda and Beni by armed groups.

“The fighting makes it very difficult, if not impossible sometimes, for our teams to reach some of these areas of displacement,” said Dana Hughes, East Africa and Great Lakes regional spokesperson for the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR).",no result found
3-May-19,no result found,Recurrent violence against the response teams is the main cause of the persistence of the epidemic httpstcoYyT8YbxGQR,Some extraordinary numbers from the Ebola response Since January there have been 119 separate attacks on Ebol httpstcoEvpTkJnMER,"Today Mike Ryan, MD, with the World Health Organization (WHO) outlined major response setbacks in trying to contain the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)—including more than 100 violent attacks since January—as cases continue to mount and deaths top 1,000.

'Continued intense transmission'

""Every time we have managed to gain control over the virus, we have suffered major security events,"" Ryan said, as he explained that the situation on the ground in North Kivu and Ituri provinces is the worst it's been in months, marred by community distrust and a growing threat from rebel groups who are using the outbreak to harness political unrest in the region.

""We anticipate a scenario of continued, intense transmission,"" Ryan said. He is the WHO assistant director-general for emergency preparedness and response.

Ryan said outbreak response efforts this week were back to the high levels seen before the late April attacks on two Ebola treatment centers in Butembo and Katwa. He estimated that health officials are following ""1,000 contacts per day, receiving 1,000 alerts, and vaccinating 1,000 people.""

But in an update yesterday, the WHO also said that access and activities in parts of Mandima, Masereka, Kalunguta, and Vuhovi remain irregular owing to the presence of armed groups and other security concerns.

Since January, 119 attacks

Since January, Ryan said, there have been 119 separate violent attacks in the region, with 42 of those attacks specifically targeting health facilities. Eighty-five health workers have been injured or killed.

Ryan said security forces yesterday thwarted an attempted attack at an Ebola treatment center in Butembo. No one was injured.

Area violence by militia groups, such as Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) recently caused tens of thousands of Congolese to flee their homes and cross over to Uganda, Oxfam said in a news release today based on a report from Oxfam and 17 other humanitarian groups. The humanitarian situation began on Mar 30, and more than 60,000 people have been displaced throughout April—half of them children.

Tamba Emmanuel Danmbi-saa, Oxfam's humanitarian program manager in the DRC, said, ""This is a deeply worrying situation. These people fear going back to their homes and are being forced to live in cramped, unsanitary conditions in an area where Ebola remains a significant threat.""

Francis Iwa, executive director of Care for Forced Migrants, said: ""Once they enter Uganda, they also are avoiding official immigration procedures and registration as refugees—which means they may not be screened for Ebola and will be unable to access the very services prepared to assist them.""

In some cases, refugees are crossing safely into Uganda; in other instances they are being used as human shields by the ADF, the relief groups said. They are calling on DRC authorities to ensure displaced people are able to cross freely and safely into Uganda.

Second vaccine possible

In addition to addressing the insecurity issues facing the response effort, Ryan also fielded questions about the possibility of introducing another vaccine into the DRC, and the role of nosocomial transmission in this outbreak.

The second vaccine, Johnson and Johnson's prime boost Ebola vaccine, would likely be used in communities that have not yet seen any Ebola infections.

""It would lay down [a] barrier to protect from the virus as a tactical approach,"" Ryan said. Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV, the only vaccine currently in use in the DRC, would still be used, but mainly on close case contacts. As of today, 110,803 people have been vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV, including 30,145 in Katwa, 23,397 in Beni, and 13,763 in Butembo, according to the DRC health ministry's daily update.

Ryan said the WHO and DRC officials would launch tomorrow a new health campaign focusing on needle safety. The misuse of needles in suspected malaria patients, who actually have Ebola, may be playing a role in the nosocomial transmission of the virus.

""We are still seeing new cases that are not on any known transmission chains,"" Ryan said. ""These often end up being nosocomial transmissions.""

Deaths hit 1,000

According to today's update from the DRC, officials confirmed 19 new cases of Ebola and 14 deaths, half of which took place in the community.

Today's cases raise the outbreak total to 1,529, of which 1,463 are confirmed and 66 are probable. Deaths have now climbed 1,008, and 270 suspected cases still under investigation. Of the 19 new cases, 7 were recorded in Beni, 6 in Katwa, 3 in Mabalako, and 1 each in Musienene, Kalunguta, and Mandima.

The WHO said the current hot spots are Katwa, Butembo, and Mandima. From Apr 10 through 30, a total of 292 confirmed cases were reported, 47% in Katwa, 13% in Butembo, and 11% in Mandima, the WHO added.

""In addition, notable recurring re-introduction events having been documented in previously affected health zones such as Mabalako and Musienene, followed by local amplification and extension to affect new heath area,"" the WHO said.

The DRC also noted today that the outbreak in Butembo was linked to reintroducing the virus in Kayna, Biena, Masereka, Vuhovi, and Kalunguta.

""While each of these areas had managed to spend more than 21 days without new confirmed cases between February and March 2019, the Ebola epidemic had resumed in these areas after contaminated people from Butembo or Katwa fled the teams of the riposte [response] to take refuge with relatives living in these neighboring areas,"" the DRC said.

May 3 Oxfam news release","The death toll in the Democratic Republic of Congo's latest Ebola outbreak has risen to more than 1,000, according to the country's health ministry, with a volatile security situation and deep community distrust complicating efforts to beat back the nine-month-old epidemic.

The Ministry of Public Health said in its latest update on Friday that 14 new deaths from the virus were recorded, taking the toll to 1,008 deaths from more than 1,450 confirmed cases registered since the epidemic erupted in August.

The ministry's update came after the World Health Organization (WHO) warned earlier on Friday that health officials were ""anticipating a scenario of continued intense transmission"" after 126 confirmed cases were reported over a seven-day stretch ending on Sunday, a record for the current outbreak.

Health ministry spokeswoman Jessica Ilunga said the surge in cases was the result of attacks on health workers and treatment centres disrupting ""response activities"" in recent weeks.

""Security has been a big issue, and every time we have an incident, essential response activities such as contact tracing, vaccination and safe burials are suspended for an indefinite period of time, giving time and space for the virus to spread,"" Ilunga told Al Jazeera.

Repeated attacks

The DRC's current Ebola outbreak, its tenth to date, emerged in eastern North Kivu province last year before spreading to the neighbouring Ituri province.

In a bid to contain the outbreak, health workers have inoculated more than 109,000 people to date as part of a government-backed vaccination programme. The vaccine is experimental, but is estimated to be 97.5 percent effective.

Efforts to beat back the virus have been hampered by ongoing unrest in the eastern DRC, however, and widespread distrust among elements of the local population towards both the central government, which postponed presidential and legislative elections in parts of the region blaming the Ebola outbreak, as well as the medical strategies deployed by emergency responders.

190328062938247

Scores of armed groups operate in the conflict-wracked region, including in the areas surrounding the North Kivu cities of Beni and Butembo, where the current outbreak is concentrated.

Ebola treatment centres and health workers have repeatedly been subject to attacks, with 119 such incidents recorded since January, according to WHO.

On Friday, Michael Ryan, WHO's emergencies chief, warned at a press conference in the Swiss city of Geneva that insecurity had become a ""major impediment to ensuring that we can access, engage with and serve the communities we wish to serve in Ebola control"".

In April, heavily armed assailants raided a hospital in Butembo and killed Richard Mouzoko, a Cameroonian WHO doctor working on the Ebola response.

The assault came after unidentified attackers in February torched two of Doctors Without Borders' (MSF) treatment facilities in North Kivu, prompting the organisation to suspend operations in the area and warn soon after that ""a climate of deepening community mistrust"" was taking a grip amid ""various political, social and economic grievances"" and an allegedly overly militarised response by authorities to the outbreak.

Widespread mistrust

Christoph Vogel, a former UN expert on the DRC and a researcher with the UK-based London School of Economics' Conflict Research Programme, said there were a ""host of different factors"" complicating the medical response and warned the recent attacks showed the climate on the ground was ""extremely poisoned"".

""It (the outbreak) is happening in an area that has witnessed entrenched armed conflict, massive violence and all sorts of distrust between different actors, communities and elites; this is probably the central factor that makes the outbreak so hard to tackle compared to other ones,"" Vogel told Al Jazeera.

Vogel cautioned it was not clear who was behind the attacks on health centres and medical professionals, but said international actors and DRC authorities should have done more to try and build trust with communities affected by the epidemic, pointing to widely held local views that the outbreak was fabricated to benefit business-owning local elites or further destabilise the region.

190309193641595

According to a recent study by the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, some 32 percent of respondents in Ebola-hit regions of the eastern DRC said they did not believe the virus existed and was instead invented for financial gains. More than 36 percent believed the epidemic was fabricated to destabilise the area.

Fewer than two-thirds of the nearly 1,000 respondents said they would take a vaccine for Ebola.

Ilunga, for her part, admitted some people in the ""historically neglected"" eastern DRC ""didn't believe"" Ebola existed and said there were ""several types of attack"" being committed against health workers, all of which were ""detrimental"" to efforts to defeat the virus.

""The majority of violence against the medical response is community violence, for instance when Ebola responders go to family homes because they have been alerted someone has died ... but when responders arrive some people chase them away,"" Ilunga said.

""But the attacks on the Ebola treatment centres are more coordinated, by some kind of organised armed groups,"" she added. ""It is worrying, especially because the future of the outbreak depends on factors outside of our, the Ministry of Health's control.""

The failure to overcome the outbreak so far has seen it evolve into the second-deadliest in recorded history, trailing an epidemic between 2013-2016 that killed about 11,300 people in West Africa as it surged through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.",no result found,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo/GENEVA (Reuters) - The death toll from an Ebola outbreak in Congo rose above 1,000 on Friday, with attacks on treatment centers continuing to hamper efforts to control the “intense transmission” of the second-worst epidemic of the virus on record.

The World Health Organization said it expected the nine-month outbreak to continue spreading though the east of Democratic Republic of Congo, and announced plans to expand vaccinations in the coming weeks once a new treatment by Johnson & Johnson is approved.

The WHO is already using another experimental vaccine made by Merck.

Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said supplies were plentiful but hostility towards medical staff was making it hard to get to affected communities.

He told reporters in Geneva that 119 attacks had been documented since January, and as a result, “we are anticipating a scenario of continued intense transmission”.

More than 100,000 people have been vaccinated so far, and the treatment has been highly effective, the WHO says.

The Merck vaccine will still be used in “ring vaccination” of people exposed to the virus and their contacts, Ryan said, but the WHO is also studying use of a single dose to stretch supplies, an option experts would review on Monday.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine would be deployed outside the rings in surrounding areas to protect people from infection, “as a way of laying down a barrier to the virus”, Ryan said.

Congo’s Health Ministry said on Friday that 14 new Ebola deaths had been recorded, taking the toll to 1,008 deaths from confirmed and probable cases.

Only the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa has been deadlier. More than 11,000 people died then out of 28,000 who were infected.

Despite significant medical advances since then, including the vaccine and experimental treatments, health officials have struggled to control the current outbreak because of the violence and community mistrust in eastern Congo, where dozens of militias are active.

Militiamen attacked a hospital treating Ebola patients two weeks ago, killing a senior WHO epidemiologist and wounding two others.

“The numbers are nothing short of terrifying,” said Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease specialist and director of the global health charity the Wellcome Trust.

“This epidemic will not be brought under control without a really significant shift in the response,” he said. “Community trust and safety, as well as community engagement and ownership of the response is critical.”

This week has been the worst by far, with more than 100 new cases in the last 5 days. Since the outbreak began last summer, there have been more than 1,500 cases, with just over 1,000 deaths.

The DRC’s Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization, along with international partners and nongovernmental organizations, are on the ground working to control the outbreak: helping provide care for the sick while trying to track down their contacts and working to vaccinate those contacts and their contacts. They are also trying to improve communication with affected communities about how Ebola is spread and how to prevent it.

Although the DRC has successfully contained Ebola outbreaks before, this one is happening in part of the country with limited infrastructure and active and dangerous militias whose actions threaten responders and have led to interruptions in disease-containment efforts. While many countries judge the situation to be too high risk to send people to help — a WHO responder was killed in a recent attack — the WHO and partners are doing dangerous response work in the country.

Despite months of this courageous and determined work, the number of new cases per day has risen steeply this week. “There might be double this many cases in reality that we’re just not aware of,” Tariq Riebl, emergency response director for the Ebola response crisis with the International Rescue Committee, told the Associated Press.

In the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the epidemic really began to accelerate when daily case counts reached the numbers we are seeing now in the DRC. It seems to us that this outbreak now meets the definition of a public health emergency of international concern, though it has not yet been officially deemed one. Whether or not such a declaration is made, there is no debate that the situation is dire and worsening. It’s a critical time to consider what more the rest of the world should be doing to help all those who are working to contain the outbreak. We believe these three steps would help.

First, countries and international donors must provide the finances the DRC, WHO, and their partners need to contain this outbreak. WHO depends on countries and donors to respond to emergencies. On April 30, WHO Director Tedros Ghebreyesus said in a statement that “WHO and its partners cannot tackle these challenges without the international community stepping in to fill the sizeable funding gap.” In the same statement, the WHO said that only half of the currently requested funds have been received, “which could lead to WHO and partners rolling back some activities precisely when they are most needed.”

It is hard to understand how WHO has been put into this position. Following the flawed early global response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic, countries established a Contingency Fund for Emergencies so the organization would not have to raise funds to mount a response to deadly outbreaks. But global contributions to the fund have fallen short of the annual target, and the WHO is once again having to ask for funds for this essential work.

The possibility of a rollback in response due to limited resources is ominous. In the past, interruptions in the work of responding to an outbreak have been followed by surges in new cases. The mere suggestion of that happening should provoke a reappraisal by leading governments and international organizations about what it will take to stop this Ebola outbreak. The West Africa Ebola outbreak ended up costing billions of dollars to contain. WHO is asking for a small fraction of that sum now. If it isn’t provided, efforts to control the outbreak will likely be far more expensive later, in terms of lives lost and funds needed.

Second, new security strategies are needed to allow public health workers to contain the virus. Violence in the region is a central reason the epidemic continues to worsen despite broad containment efforts. The DRC and the UN peacekeeping force, known as MONUSCO, have not been able to control the violence enough to allow public health response activities to proceed without interruptions. Failing to develop a security strategy risks the possibility that Ebola could spread to neighboring countries, a situation that would greatly exacerbate Ebola’s human and economic costs and further erode security in the region.

Third, governments, donors, and relevant leaders from the pharmaceutical industry should expand the Ebola vaccine supply and allow for wider use beyond the current vaccination strategy. No vaccine was available to fight previous Ebola outbreaks. There is now an investigational vaccine, produced by Merck, which appears to be safe and effective. It is being used primarily for people who have been in contact with individuals who developed Ebola, contacts of contacts, and health care workers.

This is a good strategy but it’s contingent on knowing who most of the Ebola patients are and who most of their contacts are. Unfortunately, there is too much uncertainty in both categories. Throughout the outbreak, a high percentage of cases (56% this week) were not diagnosed until individuals died in the community. This means that many case contacts are not being found or being offered vaccine.

A larger-scale vaccination campaign could take place. It would protect many more people and perhaps allow for the response to get ahead of Ebola’s spread. In addition, reports of vaccine refusal among case contacts, and even among health care workers who are at greater risk of infection, indicate that broader use of a vaccine beyond the high-priority groups may be needed to increase the level of protection in the communities where Ebola is occurring or is likely to head.

A larger vaccination strategy would require substantially more vaccine to be produced. Merck has said it has limits on its production capacity. National governments and international organizations need to work with industry to devise and fund new options that might augment the supply such as: providing resources for new production facilities, expanding the supply through reduced dosing, enlisting additional outside manufacturers of the vaccine, and/or fast-tracking other Ebola vaccines through development and regulatory processes.

It’s possible that control efforts will bring the Ebola outbreak in the DRC under better control in the coming weeks. But it is also possible that the situation could precipitously deteriorate. Government leaders and international organizations that have needed expertise and the means to help finance the response should reassess whether they are doing all they can do, either by themselves or in a coalition of the willing.

Leaders should start planning with the assumption that Ebola could get much worse quickly in the DRC. If they do, maybe together they can help the DRC, WHO, and partner organizations change the direction of this outbreak.

In research developments, a new study on the impact of intravenous (IV) fluid therapy during West Africa's outbreak found no difference in survival at the 28-day mark compared with people who didn't receive it, though the investigators said randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify its impact and role in resource-limited field settings.

Unrest and attacks

In Butembo and nearby health areas, a May 4 demonstration by taxi drivers temporarily stopped response activities after the group placed wooden barricades on the main road arteries, the health ministry said yesterday. The protesters also attacked handwashing devices throughout the city.

A day earlier, bikers tried to attack a safe and dignified burial team and their security attachment who were attending to the body of a woman from Katwa who had recently died from Ebola. Two of the bikers were shot and killed during the altercation, and an investigation is under way into their deaths, the health ministry said.

The motorcycle taxi drivers association and customary chief met with bikers and asked them not to obstruct the work of the response teams. Health officials said they expect cases to increase in days ahead, owing to a temporary interruption in response activities, a pattern that has repeatedly been seen following past attacks in the region.

In another insecurity development, DRC armed forces clashed with a Ugandan rebel group in a village in Beni, following an attack by rebels on villagers, according to DRC media reports.

Case count rises to 1,572

Of the 43 cases reported over the weekend and today, all are from known hot spots. Thirteen of the infections are in Katwa, and other affected areas include Mandima (11), Musienene (5), Mabalako (4), Butembo (3), Beni (2), Kalunguta (2), Masereka (1), Oicha (1), and Vuhovi (1).

The new illnesses boost the overall outbreak total to 1,572 cases, 1,506 of them confirmed and 66 listed as probable. Health officials are also investigating 193 suspected Ebola cases.

Thirty-seven more people died from their infections, including 19 in the community or in local hospitals. In its update today the DRC health ministry said 1 new community fatality involves a health worker from Mandima who died at home. She was a hygienist at a health post in the Katanga area and had refused vaccination.

Eighteen people died in Ebola treatment centers, 8 of them in Butembo, 3 in Mabalako, 3 in Katwa, 3 in Beni, and 1 in Mandima. The new developments lift the outbreak's fatality count to 1,045.

IV treatment shown ineffective

IV fluid (IVF) therapy for Ebola is done to prevent hypovolema and organ failure, but evidence of a benefit in outbreak settings, where delivering the therapy can be challenging, has been limited and conflicting.

In a retrospective cohort study at five International Medical Corps Ebola treatment centers in Liberia and Sierra Leone, a research team led by Brown University scientists evaluated 424 Ebola cases, 354 of whom were treated with IVF during their admission. The group described its findings in a May 3 early online edition of Clinical Infectious Diseases.

In total, 146 (41.3%) of people treated with IVF survived, and 31 patients (44.9%) who didn't receive the treatment survived. A matched propensity score analysis didn't find a significant difference in 28-day survival between people treated and not treated with IVF during their first 24 and 48 hours of care. An adjusted analysis also found no difference in 28-day survival.

The authors note that the study provides the highest-quality evidence of IVF impact on survival to date, but they included several caveats. They said Ebola patients in the treatment centers typically got IVF as a bolus, with limited ability to monitor patients when no clinicians were in the patient wards. Slower infusion and or better monitoring may lead to better outcomes.

""It is entirely possible, based on our results, that small daily volumes of IVF may improve survival while large daily volumes worsen survival,"" they wrote, adding that a larger, prospective randomized controlled trial is needed to definitively answer the question.

Despite vaccinating more than 111,000 people with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV, a highly protective unlicensed Ebola vaccine, the outbreak has worsened dramatically in the last month due to violent attacks and a communication breakdown between community members and response workers.

And cases with no connection to an ongoing transmission chain are increasingly being diagnosed.

In light of these developments, SAGE is recommending the use of a new vaccine, Johnson & Johnson's adenovirus 26 vectored glycoprotein/MVA-BN (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN), and a dose-sparing strategy with rVSV-ZEBOV, which will provide a smaller dose of the vaccine to case contacts.

""We know that vaccination is saving lives in this outbreak,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. PhD. ""We also know that we still face challenges in making sure the contacts of every case receive the vaccine as soon as possible. These recommendations account for ongoing insecurity and incorporate feedback from experts and from the affected communities that will help us continue to adapt the response.""

Dose changes should not limit efficacy

Since August, a ring vaccination strategy has been used in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, which demands that close case contacts and front line health workers are the first to receive the vaccine, followed by a widening circle of contacts' contacts.

SAGE's new proposal will have people at highest risk (contacts and contacts of contacts) receiving 0.5 mL of vaccine instead of 1 mL. This dosage is equal to the dose used in the successful Ebola ring vaccination trial in Guinea in 2015, and is expected to provide the same level of protection, SAGE said.

SAGE also recommends vaccinating a tertiary set of people: those who live in villages and neighborhoods where cases have been reported within the past 21 days, but are not case contacts or contacts of contacts. Those people could be administered rVSV-ZEBOV at a dose of 0.2 mL (one-fifth of the current dose).

""Increasing access to vaccination in the broader community may help enhance community acceptance of the vaccine and other control measures,"" SAGE said.

To address issues of insecurity and violence, SAGE recommends vaccination happen at ""pop-up"" stations in remote villages, and not at contact's homes.

Finally, SAGE said they recommend recruiting and training more Congolese medical staff to carry out the vaccinations. ""The goal is that by end of the month a majority of vaccination team members are healthcare workers, doctors, and medical students from affected communities who also speak the local languages,"" SAGE said.

More than 100 cases in first week of May

The DRC's ministry of health will likely confirm 13 more cases of Ebola today, raising the outbreak total to 1,585, according to data on the WHO online Ebola dashboard.

According to the latest update from the WHO's African regional office, there have been 115 Ebola cases confirmed since Apr 28, including 98 deaths.

""Katwa is still the main focus of the outbreak, reporting 41% (121/292) of all confirmed cases in the past 21 days,"" the WHO said. Two more health workers have also been diagnosed as having Ebola, raising the total number of affected health workers to 94, with 33 deaths.

Besides Katwa, Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Mandima, Katwa, Mabalako, Musienene and Vuhovi have reported new cases within the last week, and bed occupancy has been reached at the Mangina Ebola treatment center and the Kayna transit center.

WHO online Ebola dashboard",no result found,no result found,"GENEVA (Reuters) - World Health Organization experts recommended on Tuesday a dramatic expansion of vaccination against Ebola in Congo after a surge in cases showed that the strategy of vaccinating those known to be exposed to the disease was no longer sufficient.

Health workers fighting against the second worst Ebola epidemic in history are now implementing a “ring” strategy, vaccinating anyone directly exposed to known cases of Ebola, and a second ring of those exposed to people in the first ring.

But after four weeks of sharp increases in cases, the World Health Organization’s strategic advisory group (SAGE) of outside experts said the vaccine programme was no longer big enough.

A large share of new cases are now occurring in people who were not known contacts of earlier patients, and the disease is spreading to areas where it is impossible to trace contacts and swiftly vaccinate them.

It recommended a number of changes, including expanding vaccination to a third ring of people exposed to those in the second ring, and “geographic” vaccinations that would target everyone at a location without trying to track their exposure.

To prevent supplies of the vaccine, made by Merck, from running out in a much larger vaccination programme, the WHO experts recommended using smaller doses. A second experimental vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson should also be rolled out.

“We know that vaccination is saving lives in this outbreak,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. “These recommendations account for ongoing insecurity and incorporate feedback from experts and from the affected communities that will help us continue to adapt the response.”

Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, welcomed the recommendations and described the Congo outbreak as “in a truly frightening phase”.

“If there is any hope of bringing it under control there has to be a significant shift in the response,” he said in a comment emailed to Reuters. “Without support for this new approach this epidemic could reach the scale of the terrible events in West Africa in 2013-2016.”

Farrar was referring to the largest Ebola outbreak in history, which infected 28,000 people in a vast epidemic that spread through Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2013 and 2016. More than 11,300 people died.

In the current Congo outbreak, the WHO says more than 111,000 people have been vaccinated since August. So far 1,045 of the 1,572 people with confirmed or probable Ebola have died in the outbreak, which has hit areas long prone to unrest.

SAGE said the number of cases had risen rapidly in the past four weeks because security incidents had dramatically affected the tracing and monitoring of people who may have come into contact with Ebola.

The Merck vaccine could run short if the outbreak continues, and doses should be halved to 0.5 ml for the primary and secondary rings, SAGE said, while they also proposed vaccination of a tertiary ring of contacts, who would receive 0.2 ml.",no result found

Response curtailed for 4th day

A report from Radio Moto Butemo-Beni said Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) armed forces and police clashed with militia members in Butembo this morning, resulting in 10 deaths, which included some attackers and a police officer. The militia members dispersed, and their motives aren't clear. The city's mayor asked locals to work with the police to find the attackers.

According to a Reuters report, security forces repelled the attackers before they could reach the city's Ebola treatment centers and made several arrests.

Meanwhile, outbreak response activities weren't able to fully resume yesterday because of a rumor spreading on social media that claimed a response vehicle struck and killed a motorcycle taxi driver, raising the threat of public protests, the DRC's health ministry said in its daily update yesterday.

The rumor followed an incident on May 3 in which motorcycle taxi drivers apparently tried to attack a safe and dignified burial team, during which two drivers were shot and killed, sparking a demonstration in Butembo that stopped response activities.

The taxi drivers' association denied the rumor, but did say a driver was in an accident but did not die and continued to work that day. ""Since the beginning of May, this is the fourth consecutive day in which the teams have not been able to carry out all the necessary response activities to Butembo,"" the ministry said.

At a meeting yesterday between the city's urban safety committee and motorcycle taxi drivers, the bikers said they have been infiltrated by outsiders who are responsible for incidents with a goal of destabilizing the city.

Plans are in the works to take a census of all legitimate taxi drivers, and the safety committee warned that if more incidents continue, they will take tougher action against the drivers.

In yet another security incident, the ministry said protesters burned the triage service of Sainte Famille Mukuna hospital center in Katwa health zone.

WHO notes search for contacts in Kampala

In its latest weekly situation report, the World Health Organization (WHO) said events over the past week reflect a deteriorating security situation in Butembo, with threats of attacks persisting against some health facilities and providers in the wake of the latest violence.

Most of the 106 cases reported over the past week have been in Katwa, Mandima, Butembo, Musienene, Beni, and Mabalako health zones.

To address the insecurity in Butembo, the WHO said the United Nations security management system will update the security risk management process by addressing procedural, operational, and security measures.

The number of infected health workers has grown to 95, one more than reported yesterday in the WHO's regional officer report. Deaths in the group are at 34, also reflecting an increase of one.

In its review of contact tracing, the WHO said that on May 5 a 37-year-old man who is a known contact of an Ebola patient traveled from Beni to Kampala, Uganda, through the DRC border town of Kasindi for healthcare. However, information that he was missing didn't reach the Kasindi entry point until the man had crossed the border already.

Investigators are trying to locate and monitor the man's health status.

Officials weigh vaccine applications

On Twitter today DRC health ministry reported 15 more Ebola infections, lifting the outbreak total to 1,600 cases. Officials said they will post the full report tomorrow.

Fourteen more people died from their infections, boosting the fatality count to 1,069.

Yesterday, the health ministry reported 13 new cases from seven locations, including 2 in Lubero, which hadn't reported in a new infection in several weeks.

Regarding the alternative vaccination strategy recommendations the a WHO advisory group announced yesterday—which included adding the Johnson & Johnson Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN vaccine—the health ministry said it hasn't yet approved the use of another vaccine besides Merck's VSV-EBOV. Authorities, however, said they have received applications for the use of three other vaccines and are considering them.

Butembo is one focus of Congo’s worst ever outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever, which has killed more than 1,000 people since mid-2018.

Efforts to contain the virus have been hampered by attacks on treatment centers by armed groups operating in Congo’s lawless east as well as by distrust among local residents, many of whom view the disease as a conspiracy.

Butembo mayor Sylvain Kanyamanda Mbusa told Reuters that eight militiamen and one police officer were killed in fighting as the gunmen tried to storm the city.

Security forces successfully repelled the attack before the assailants could reach the city’s Ebola treatment centers and made several arrests, Kanyamanda said.

9-May-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak response this past week continues to be hampered by insecurity. On 3 May in Katwa, a Safe and Dignified Burial (SDB) team was violently attacked following the completion of a burial for a deceased EVD case. In Butembo and surrounding health zones, response activities were repeatedly halted due to a number of serious security incidents taking place from 4-6 May. On 8 May, a group of over 50 armed militia infiltrated the city centre. Security forces repelled the attack following intense gunfire in close proximity to staff accommodations. Although activities resumed on 9 May, after almost five consecutive days of suspension, threats of further attacks against EVD response teams and facilities remain prevalent.

These security incidents, and especially the resultant lack of access to EVD affected communities, remain a major impediment to the response, with teams unable to perform robust surveillance nor deliver much needed treatment and immunisations. The ongoing violent attacks sow fear, perpetuate mistrust, and further compound the multitude of challenges already faced by frontline healthcare workers. Without commitment from all groups to cease these attacks, it is unlikely that this EVD outbreak can remain successfully contained in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

EVD transmission remains most intense in Katwa, Butembo, Mandima, Mabalako, Musienene, Beni and Kalunguta hotspot health zones, which collectively account for the vast majority (93%) of the 303 cases reported in the last 21 days between 17 April – 7 May 2019 (Figure 1 and Table 1). During this period, new cases were reported from 78 health areas within 15 of the 21 health zones affected to date (Figure 2). It is expected that the resumption of response activities will bring a substantial increase in the number of cases reported in the coming weeks due to the backlog from the disruptions.

As of 7 May, a total of 1600 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 1069 died (case fatality of 67%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 57% (907) were female and 30% (475) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 97 (6% of total cases). 442 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been successfully discharged.

Adapted vaccination strategies

On 7 May 2019, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) issued new vaccination recommendations in light of the increasing number of EVD cases and continued insecurity in this outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (click here for the full recommendations). The panel made recommendations pertaining to adjusting vaccine dosages, expanding vaccine eligibility, ring vaccination operational improvements, and strengthening training of local healthcare workers to aid in the EVD response.

The rVSV ZEBOV GP vaccine dosage and eligibility criteria have been revised. For high-risk individuals such as contacts and contacts of contacts, the new SAGE recommendations advise the use of 0.5mL of vaccine instead of 1mL. This revised dose has been previously used during the 2015 Ebola ça Suffit! trial in Guinea, and is expected to provide similar efficacy in this current EVD outbreak. Those at lower risks are now to receive 0.2mL instead. SAGE also recommends expanding the accessibility of the vaccine to more individuals in affected health areas. In addition to high-risk individuals, it is now recommended that individuals who are potential contacts due to their residence in the villages or neighbourhoods with incident cases (i.e. where EVD cases have been reported in the last 21 days) be offered the rVSV ZEBOV GP vaccine. SAGE believes that by expanding vaccine eligibility, this would address some of the requests from communities in affected health areas for the vaccine to be more widely available, foster greater trust, and improve willingness of communities to engage with other EVD response activities.

SAGE advised the implementation of an adaptive operational approach to ring vaccinations, implemented in two main methods: pop-up vaccinations and targeted geographic vaccinations. Pop-up vaccination would be conducted by inviting contacts and contacts of contacts to a previously agreed upon temporary location some distance away from the residence of contacts. In areas where accurate identification of contacts and contacts of contacts is not possible due to insecurity, targeted geographic vaccination of whole villages or quartiers would be administered at a fixed location with security present. Both of these vaccination operational methods have been utilised successfully before, and are expected to make the vaccination process more efficient and secure for both healthcare providers and the patients they are caring for.

SAGE additionally recommends offering an alternative vaccine (other than rVSV-ZEBOV-GP) to those at lower risk within affected health areas or neighbouring areas. WHO has reviewed evidence provided by two vaccine manufacturers, and the adenovirus 26 vectored glycoprotein / MVA-BN (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN) investigational Ebola vaccine is being considered and evaluated by a coalition led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. At this time, this vaccine is in the late stages of formal trials and is expected to be deployed to the field in the near future. These efforts are in line with previous SAGE recommendations regarding the need for more studies to assess the efficacy of additional, alternative Ebola vaccines.

SAGE also supported the proposal to introduce alternative individual informed consent forms and follow up procedures which can potentially simplify and expedite both the vaccination and safety follow up processes. Aside from pregnant women who will be actively followed up until delivery or end of pregnancy, and infants 6-12 months of age who will receive a single visit at day 21, all other case follow up will be completed through passive reporting of adverse events via telephone.

In addition to technical recommendations, WHO and partners are working closely with residents of Ebola-affected communities to empower them to take on greater ownership of the EVD response. Through intensifying training and engagement with local community members, WHO aims to have the majority of vaccination teams comprised of local healthcare providers by the end of the month. Other key elements to transferring ownership of the response to the communities includes fulfilling community requests made in relation to development projects, and ensuring all persons residing in at-risk areas are well-informed about the status of the outbreak, transmission prevention, and availability of care through further mass communication initiatives.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigated local spread. However, these efforts must continue to be scaled-up at this time.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) ministry of health confirmed that Ebola outbreak response activities partially resumed today in Butembo, after being suspended for 5 days due to several acts of violence.

Four cases of Ebola were confirmed, and 5 new deaths were recorded, raising the outbreak's total to 1,604 cases, including 1,074 deaths. A total of 264 suspected cases are still under investigation. The low number of reported cases, after a month of increased activity, likely reflects a lag in reporting caused by the security incidents.

Yesterday, DRC officials said two Katwa health workers—including one who had been vaccinated—had contracted Ebola, raising the number of health workers infected in this outbreak to 97.

In an update today, the World Health Organization (WHO) said more violent attacks will likely expand the outbreak beyond North Kivu and Ituri provinces. In the past 21 days, 93% of cases have originated in Katwa, Butembo, Mandima, Mabalako, Musienene, Beni, and Kalunguta health zones.

""The ongoing violent attacks sow fear, perpetuate mistrust, and further compound the multitude of challenges already faced by frontline healthcare workers,"" the WHO said.

WHO profiles recent Saudi MERS cases as country notes new one

The WHO today provided more details on 36 MERS-CoV cases, 12 of them fatal, reported from Saudi Arabia between Mar 1 and Apr 8 that weren't part of a large outbreak in Wadi ad-Dawasir.

Of the 36 cases, 10 were in Khafji and 6 in Riyadh. Nine patients had a history of exposure to camels or camel milk, and 12 had been exposed to another MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) patient. Five involved healthcare workers, all from Eastern region, presumably linked to the illnesses in Khafji.

Patient ages ranged from 22 to 80, and all but 8 of them were male. Three apparently had asymptomatic infections, and 24 had underlying medical conditions.

The WHO said the new cases don't change its overall MERS-CoV risk assessment. The agency added that it expects cases to continue to be reported in the Middle East, along with possible exported cases involving people who contract the virus from camels, animal products such as camel milk, and humans, especially those in healthcare settings.

Since 2012 when the virus was first detected in humans the WHO has been notified of 2,419 MERS-CoV cases, at least 836 of them fatal. The vast majority are from Saudi Arabia.

May 9 WHO update

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a new illness in a 31-year-old man from Riyadh, according to a May 7 update to its epidemiologic week 19 report. It's not known if the man had contact with camels, and the source of his exposure is listed as primary, meaning he probably wasn't exposed to sick patients. The case raises the 2019 Saudi total to 137 infections.

CWD confirmed on deer farm in Crow Wing County, Minnesota

The Minnesota Board of Animal Health (MBAH) announced yesterday that at least seven animals at Trophy Woods Ranch, a captive deer farm in Crow Wing County, Minnesota, suffered from chronic wasting disease (CWD) in the last 2 years, and the animals likely spread the prion disease to deer in the wild.

On Apr 16, animals at Trophy Woods Ranch were depopulated and tested for CWD after the ranch closed when a wild female deer near the property was found dead from CWD. A total of 102 deer were removed from the farm, and all viable samples were sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory for CWD testing.

Seven animals tested positive for CWD, which raised the total number of CWD-infected animals associated with Trophy Woods to 14, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. Thirteen animals were too decomposed for testing.

""The results give us a clearer picture of the disease prevalence on the farm as we continue our efforts to contain and eliminate any remaining infectious CWD prions in the enclosed property,"" said Linda Glaser, DVM, the assistant director of MBAH, in an MBAH news release.

CWD is a fatal prion disease in cervids, and has been documented across the United States, and in Canada, Scandinavia, and South Korea. The disease likely spreads when infected animals shed prions in saliva, feces, urine, and other fluids or tissues. No human cases have been recorded, but eating contaminated meat is not advised.

As of yesterday the man, 38, was hospitalized and in stable condition in an isolation ward at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. An additional 22 case contacts are under quarantine, health officials said.

The Singapore Times reported the man had attended a wedding in Nigeria shortly before his trip, and may have consumed bush meat during the celebration. Monkeypox is often transmitted from animals to humans via contaminated meat or rodents who have come into contact with infected animals.

Though human-to-human transmission is possible, it requires very close contact. Monkeypox is a self-limiting disease, with most symptoms resolving within 3 weeks.

May 9 Singapore Times story","Dozens of fighters from an armed group known as Mai-Mai went into the northeastern city of Butembo in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and fought with security forces on Wednesday.

Their target was an Ebola treatment centre. This comes as the region experiences a violent uprising and armed groups try to turn efforts to fight Ebola into a political tool.

Al Jazeera's Ijeoma Ndukwe reports.",no result found,no result found,"Doctors and health workers marched in the Eastern Congo town of Butembo in April, after attackers shot and killed an epidemiologist from Cameroon who was working for the WHO.

The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is threatening to spiral out of control, with ongoing violence aimed at the Ebola response workers undermining efforts to stop spread of the deadly virus.

STAT spoke to a number of experts involved with or closely monitoring the situation to try to get a sense of where the outbreak in northeastern DCR is heading.

Each one agreed: A disaster is unfolding.

“The numbers in the last month have been horrifying,” said Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, a major funder of the Ebola response. “It’s on a knife edge. I’m not sure how else to describe it, really.”

The World Health Organization is doing scenario mapping trying to figure out just how bad this outbreak might become. But Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the emergencies program, won’t share what they see as they look at their models. “That’s for planning purposes, not for speculation,” Ryan insisted in an interview with STAT on Monday.

The statistics are grim: Double-digit daily increases in the case count are now the norm. Most new cases are people who never hit the radar of the teams searching for those who have been exposed to the virus, so they were never offered the experimental Ebola vaccine being used to try to contain the outbreak. Treatment centers are under armed guard, protecting health workers but discouraging people with Ebola from seeking their care, people familiar with the situation say.

Ebola treatment centers and roadside checkpoints have been torched; response workers have been beaten. On April 19, Dr. Richard Mouzoko, an epidemiologist from Cameroon working for the World Health Organization, was murdered when gunmen burst into a meeting he was leading.

Given the real threat to their staff, some organizations have reduced the number of non-Congolese workers they have on the ground in Butembo and Katwa, the epicenters of transmission. Contingency planning has some agencies simultaneously trying to figure out what conditions would prompt them to return some international staff to the outbreak zone and what might trigger a total withdrawal.

Even the WHO’s Ryan admitted that if this were some other emergency, not an Ebola outbreak, the danger the response workers face would likely have led to a withdrawal by now.

“I honestly, honestly, honestly think that in very many other humanitarian situations, that decision might have been taken already,” Ryan said.

But that’s not an option with Ebola, which is currently killing about 66% of people who are being infected in this outbreak, now in its 10th month. As of Sunday, there were 1,572 cases reported and 1,045 deaths. It’s the second largest outbreak on record and will soon be four times bigger than the third on the list.

“If we leave, the disease spreads. And then it will be huge,” Ryan said. “And then we’re going to end up expending more resources, we’re going to end up with more people dead, and we’re going to end up taking exactly the same risks to stop it, but at a much higher scale of exposure.”

As it is, the cost of running the operation is crippling. Ryan said recently the organizations working on the response have an urgent funding gap of $54 million, which, if not soon filled, could see some forced to scale back their operations because they cannot pay staff.

The frustrating thing for the people leading and working on the outbreak response is that the steps needed to stop an Ebola outbreak are well-known. Even in the days before the vaccine was developed, finding and isolating cases, monitoring the health of their contacts, and quickly isolating those who become sick and burying safely those who succumb has time and again broken the chains of Ebola transmission.

But this time, persistent resistance from the people in the affected communities, fueled by decades of conflict in the region, has rendered the response teams incapable of putting into effect these tried and true measures.

“Do we lack the operational capacity to stop Ebola? No. Do we lack the tools to stop Ebola? No. What we lack right now is the environment, the access, the enablement,” said Ryan. “Too many disabling factors — from security to money — that really hold us back on a daily basis.”

The failure to contain the epidemic is raising fears of catastrophe.

Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, called the situation unprecedented.

“We are truly in uncharted Ebola-control territory,” Osterholm said. “Even in the 2014-15 [Ebola] epidemic in West Africa, once public health programs and vaccination efforts were put into place, it brought about a rather rapid reduction of cases. We’ve never encountered a situation where a geographic region becomes almost completely impossible to work in because of insecurity.”

If a way isn’t found quickly to bend the outbreak trajectory, an explosion of cases will follow, Farrar, from the Wellcome Trust, predicted.

“I think at the moment it’s in a phase where it could expand out of control very easily. Or we’re on the cusp of that already,” he said, suggesting cases could soon rise by 30 or 40 a day as opposed to the current 15 to 20.

Farrar and others warned that official numbers likely don’t capture the true picture of the outbreak at this point, because the response teams’ ability to move about and conduct surveillance in the affected areas is limited and frequently interrupted.

The International Rescue Committee, one of the partners in the response, is working on the assumption that the true number of new cases every day is already double what the official figures show, said Bob Kitchen, vice president for emergencies and humanitarian action, who was recently in the outbreak zone to assess the state of affairs.

In January and February it appeared that control measures were beginning to have an impact. The number of new cases being diagnosed daily was starting to decline and it looked like the outbreak might be coming under control.

But in late February, fire-bombings at the Ebola treatment centers at Katwa and Butembo marked a tipping point, with Ebola control operations and staff coming under regular attack ever since.

Each violent event forces a temporary slowdown of control operations. Last Thursday teams vaccinated nearly 1,000 people in one day — a record. On Saturday, they weren’t able to vaccinate anyone in Butembo, because it was too unsafe for them to move about, Ryan said.

“That interrupted access, three days of access, then two days without access … you can’t run an effective public health operation that requires daily follow up, daily vaccination, daily contact with families,” he said.

Kitchen’s organization has a lead role on promoting proper infection control in hospitals and public spaces — things like teaching clinics about the dangers of re-using needles, which is thought to be one of the drivers for transmission in this outbreak. About a quarter of the cases have contracted Ebola in a health-care setting; this mode of transmission accounts for the extraordinarily large number of infections among young children — more than 400 cases — in this epidemic.

Because of the violence, all but two of IRC’s international staff have been pulled back to Goma, a regional hub that is about eight hours drive south of the major outbreak zone. To date the virus hasn’t moved into Goma, though the fear of that possibility haunts the outbreak responders.

Community anger at the Ebola response workers is just running too high in Butembo and Katwa, where opposition politicians and others have insisted Ebola isn’t real or is a disease outsiders brought to the area.

“All the guesthouses, all the hotels, all the health facilities — the government has placed security outside,” Kitchen said, arguing that being guarded by Congolese soldiers actually increases the risk for international staff in this part of the country, which has been at odds with the central government for decades. “You’re just waving a flag. … ‘We’re over here.’”

Overcoming the resistance is proving to be extraordinarily challenging. The people of Butembo and Katwa are highly suspicious of outsiders, Ryan and others said. So suspicious, in fact, that their definition of outsiders includes people from Beni, a city about 36 miles north that was the hotspot for Ebola transmission last autumn. Some of the organizations brought in workers from Beni thinking it would help with containment efforts, but they were not accepted.

“Butembo is just this sort of enclave. So anyone from outside of Butembo and Katwa are seen as outsiders and are distrusted,” Kitchen said.

The IRC is working through what conditions on the ground would have to look like before it felt safe redeploying more international workers to the hot zone. “But if attacks continue, yes, I do foresee having to withdraw our expats and manage remotely as best we can,” he added.

Farrar warned that the best-case scenario likely involves this outbreak dragging on for months. “We will still be having these conversations throughout 2019,” he said.

Worst-case scenarios stray into unthinkable territory. “Once you lose control … the numbers just go up and up and up. And then you just can’t follow everybody. And then it’s self perpetuating, really,” he warned. “We’re not quite there yet, but we’re pretty close.”

“Predicting the future is always stupid,” Farrar said flatly. “But from where we are today to bring the epidemic under control is going to take a monumental effort. … All of the interventions we have working at maximum efficiency — and then a lot of luck.”"
10-May-19,no result found,Do you want to follow daily the evolution of epidemic Ebola in the DRC Register the mailing list httpstcohDoKWYr3yp,From yesterday The Ebola response reported they were only able to follow about 57 of known case contacts ie mo httpstcoJccGbnMBFO,"The World Health Organization's (WHO's) top official today said he was ""profoundly worried"" about the rising threat of Ebola spreading to other parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and to neighboring countries, as the country's health ministry today reported 23 new cases.

On Twitter, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said most operations have resumed in the wake of the most recent attacks, but the disruptions and a testing backlog will lead to a rise in the number of cases reported over the coming days.

Since the current outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces began in August, several violent incidents, some with resulting community protest, have disrupted the outbreak response and triggered spikes in new cases.

""When we cannot reach people, they do not get the chance to be vaccinated or to receive treatments if they fall ill. The tragedy is that we have the technical means to stop Ebola, but until all parties halt attacks on the response, it will be very difficult to end this outbreak,"" Tedros said.

He also said major surge in political and financial support from all national and international groups is urgently needed to help stop the outbreak.

New probable cases added, UN official visits Butembo

In its daily update, the DRC health ministry said the 23 new cases were from 9 different locations, including 5 from Katwa and 5 from Butembo, two of the main hot spots. Also, officials added 22 more probable cases to the total, which are people in who died in the community between Jan 30 and May 8 for whom it wasn't possible to get samples but after investigations were found to have links to confirmed cases. The developments push the overall outbreak total to 1,649 cases, 1,561 confirmed and 88 probable.

Response teams are still investigating 310 suspected Ebola cases.

Nine more people died from their infections, eight of them from six different communities and one in Katwa's Ebola treatment centers. The fatalities push the death total in the outbreak to 1,105.

In other developments, the ministry said Leila Zerrougui, the United Nations secretary-general's special representative in the DRC and head of the group's DRC peacekeeping mission MONUSCO, visited response teams in Butembo today to discuss the deteriorating security situation in Butembo and surrounding areas.

She reiterated support for the response teams and urged groups to better align their intelligence to respond to challenges and build trust with communities.

Public health needs peace negotiators

Yesterday in a New England Journal of Medicine commentary on epidemic preparedness, Jeremy Farrar, MD, PhD, director of the Wellcome Trust, said armed conflicts in unstable parts can fuel disease transmission as people try to move, making safe caregiving all but impossible.

He said the northeastern DRC setting for the Ebola outbreak has been tragically unstable for 20 years, and the tragic impact of the instability became clear when the outbreak began last August.

The outbreak might be impossible to contain, as long as violence repeatedly cripples the response. ""And every day the epidemic continues, the risk of a national and regional health disaster grows,"" Farrar warned.

New approaches are needed to resolve tensions within and between countries, local communities, armed factions, groups of health and humanitarian workers, and national and international security forces, he said.

""Peace negotiators with experience in conflict resolution are needed in public health now. Without their skills, potential pandemics will fester unchecked in vulnerable regions of the world, leading, sooner or later, to catastrophe,"" Farrar said, adding that Germany is in a strong position to lead efforts to stabilize global health in insecure situations, given its prioritization of preparedness issues during its G7 and G20 presidencies.

May 10 DRC update

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Twitter feed

May 9 N Engl J Med commentary","The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned it may not be possible to contain the Democratic Republic of the Congo's latest Ebola outbreak to two affected provinces in the country's east if violent attacks on health workers and treatment centres continue.

In a statement on Friday, WHO said it was ""unlikely"" the virus would ""remain successfully contained"" in North Kivu and Ituri - which combined, border Rwanda, Uganda and South Sudan - unless the targeting of response activities ended.

The current outbreak is the second-worst in recorded history and has killed 1,105 people so far, with efforts to end the nine-month-old epidemic complicated by a volatile security situation and widespread community distrust.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said he was ""profoundly worried"" by the outbreak's recent trends.

""The increased transmission rates raise the risk of Ebola spreading in DRC and to surrounding countries,"" Ghebreyesus said in a tweet.

""The tragedy is that we have the technical means to stop Ebola, but until all parties halt attacks on the response, it will be very difficult to end this outbreak,"" he added.

Earlier this week, fighters from the armed Mai-Mai rebel group attacked a treatment centre in Butembo, a town at the epicentre of the crisis.

The assault followed a ""violent attack"" on a burial team on May 3 after they interred an Ebola victim in the town of Katwa, east of Butembo, WHO said, adding it was forced to halt response activities in Butembo and surrounding areas for five days due to the insecurity.

190503133152074

""The ongoing violent attacks sow fear, perpetuate mistrust, and further compound the multitude of challenges already faced by front-line healthcare workers,"" the WHO said in its statement.

Deepening security crisis

Eastern DRC has experienced decades of violence, with scores of armed groups operating throughout the region, which has historically been neglected by the central government in Kinshasa.

In addition to armed groups active in the area, the health workers have faced widespread community distrust over the Ebola outbreak, with segments of the local population believing it was fabricated for the financial gain of business-owning local elites or to further destabilise the area.

""The security challenges are twofold: armed groups that have been present in the region for decades, and community hostility, which has now morphed from targeting facilities to targeting response workers,"" said Whitney Elmer, DRC director for US-based NGO Mercy Corps, in a statement.

""The impact of the rise in violence is clear; security incidents affect response activities. The virus does not take a break - after every interruption in activities, there is an increase in Ebola infections,"" Elmer added.

More than 100 attacks on Ebola treatment centres and health workers have been recorded since the beginning of the year, according to the WHO.

In April, heavily armed assailants raided a hospital in Butembo and killed Richard Mouzoko, a Cameroonian WHO doctor working on the Ebola response.

The assault came after unidentified attackers in February torched two Doctors Without Borders (known by its French initials MSF) treatment facilities in North Kivu, prompting the organisation to suspend operations in the area.

190309193641595

It warned soon after that ""a climate of deepening community mistrust"" was taking a grip amid ""various political, social and economic grievances"" and an allegedly overly militarised response by authorities to the outbreak.

'Unprecedented challenge'

David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, cautioned on Friday that, amid the violence, the outbreak now posed an ""unprecedented challenge"" for the DRC and the international community, warning the increasingly volatile atmosphere was ""making progress against the disease impossible"".

""The situation is far more dangerous than the statistic of 1,000 deaths, itself the second-largest in history, suggests, and the suspension of key services threatens to create a lethal inflection point in the trajectory of the disease,"" Miliband said in a statement after meeting health workers in the regional capital, Goma.

This Ebola outbreak, happening in an area of active conflict with widespread poverty & deep political divisions, is an unprecedented challenge for the DRC, and for world. The situation is far more dangerous than the statistic of 1000 deaths, itself the 2nd largest in history. — David Miliband (@DMiliband) May 10, 2019

In a bid to contain the virus, health workers have inoculated more than 111,000 people to date as part of a government-backed vaccination programme. The vaccine is experimental, but is estimated to be 97.5 percent effective.

But recorded cases have continued to surge amid the rising insecurity, culminating in a record 126 confirmed cases reported over a seven-day stretch ending April 28, prompting the WHO to warn of ""a scenario of continued intense transmission"".

The world's worst epidemic of Ebola, a haemorrhagic fever, killed about 11,300 people in West Africa as it raced through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia from 2013 to 2016.

Additional reporting by David Child: @DavidChild90",no result found,"DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Democratic Republic of Congo’s Ebola outbreak is unlikely to be contained unless violence stops, said the World Health Organization, after attacks halted work for almost five days.

The world’s second biggest Ebola outbreak has killed more than 1,000 people in a part of eastern Congo plagued by militia violence. Distrust by local residents has further hampered the response, with health workers and centers repeatedly attacked.

In the past week a burial team was attacked in the town of Katwa and 50 militiamen stormed the city of Butembo, the epicenter of the outbreak, in addition to a number of other “serious security incidents” in Ebola hot spots, said WHO.

“Without commitment from all groups to cease these attacks, it is unlikely that this EVD (Ebola virus disease) outbreak can remain successfully contained in North Kivu and Ituri provinces,” the agency said in a statement.

High transmission rates in recent weeks raise the risk of a spread to other provinces and countries, a WHO spokesman added.

Each time the response is suspended due to violence there is a spike in the number of cases, aid agencies said.

“This disruption in programming is the longest yet and our teams are concerned that this will lead to a surge in the number of cases,” said David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), on Friday.

The increasingly volatile situation “is making progress against the disease impossible,” he said in a statement.

The outbreak has killed 1,074 people out of a total of 1,604 confirmed or probable cases, according to the health ministry.

The world’s worst epidemic of Ebola, a hemorrhagic fever, killed more than 11,300 people in West Africa from 2013 to 2016.

Better information sharing and security analysis would help, since agencies do not always know who is responsible for attacks or what areas are safe, said Whitney Elmer, Congo country director for international charity Mercy Corps.

“What’s not happening right now is a systematic way that the information is coming together. This would help us make decisions more quickly,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted on Friday that he was “profoundly worried”.

Four new cases involve healthcare workers, not necessarily doctors. The headline was corrected later on May 13.

Once again, violent clashes in the Ebola outbreak region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have resulted in a spike of cases. Over the weekend and through today, the DRC's ministry of health recorded 56 new Ebola cases, including 4 in healthcare workers, and 19 new deaths.

The new cases bring the outbreak total to 1,705, including 1,124 deaths. A total of 251 suspected cases are still under investigation. The total number of health workers infected during the outbreak is now 101.

All newly infected health workers, from Mabalako, Kalunguta, Butembo, and Manugurujipa, were unvaccinated. The DRC health ministry reported 13 new cases on May 11, 18 yesterday, and 25 today.

As of today, 114,553 people have been vaccinated against Ebola, including more than 28,000 front-line health workers.

Several cities and villages reported new cases over the last 3 days, including 14 in Kalunguta and 13 in Mbalako. Of the 19 deaths, 15 took place in the community, which raises the risk of further disease transmission.

Evaluating treatment center after MSF departure

Two months ago, Doctors without Borders (MSF) withdrew staff from Butembo and Katwa amid increasing security threats, and the operation of Butembo and Katwa's Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) transferred to the ministry of health, the World Health Organization, and UNICEF.

Yesterday the ministry of health published an evaluation of ETC activity, which showed that the average duration of hospital stays has decreased since MSF left the region, with lengths of stay in Butembo going from an average of 9 to 7 days, and stays in Katwa shortening from 7 to 5 days.

The ETCs are now more heavily staffed, the ministry of health said.

""From now on, the whole of the medical staff is Congolese and has been recruited locally,"" the ministry said. A dedicated admissions staff, more psychologists, and a nutritional care team have also been added to the ETCs.

Moreover, survival rates increased at both ETCs. Excluding patients who die within 48 hours of admission, the case-fatality rate for confirmed patients decreased from 43.4% to 31.1% in Butembo, and from 43.2% to 33.8% in Katwa.

Cure of baby, death of assailant

The DRC health ministry yesterday also noted a different success story. Officials said a 42-day-old baby was discharged from the Katwa ETC that day. The baby girl was admitted to the treatment center on Apr 11 with her mother, who died the next day.

""After 30 days of treatment with mAb 114 [a monoclonal antibody', Daniella was cured,"" the DRC said. ""She survived thanks to the work of the health staff and the nannies who took turns at her bedside 24 hours a day but also because she was taken care of as soon as she became ill.""

And the health ministry today in its daily report confirmed the death of a man in Butembo who was a suspected member of a local militia group attacking a treatment center. He was killed by security forces.

Also today, the European Union announced it would be donating another €5 million ($5.6 million) to the DRC, raising the total number of funds to the outbreak to €17 million ($19.1 million), the European Commission (EC) said in a news release.

FILE PHOTO: Mike Ryan, emergencies chief at the World Health Organization (WHO), attends a news conference on the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo at the U.N. headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland May 3, 2019. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse

The epidemic has moved through northeastern Congo, killing 1,117 people since mid-2018. A rapid international response with an effective vaccine has managed to stop the spread in a string of towns, including Beni, Kyondo, Komanda, Tchomia, Mabalako, Mandima and Kayna, WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan said.

But in two towns, Butembo and Katwa, there has been persistent infection and reinfection, Ryan he told an audience at Geneva’s Graduate Institute.

“They see (DRC capital) Kinshasa as being as far away as New York. Anyone from more than 5 miles down the road, or maybe sometimes 500 meters, is an outsider,” he said.

“They are very distrusting of outside influence. And certainly getting this community on board has been a challenge, and missteps have been made along the way in doing that.”

Ryan added that there were “myriad” Mai-Mai militia groups, with at least 21 around Butembo and Katwa alone, some leaning toward criminal activity and many being manipulated by political causes.

“There is a lot of political gaming going on in this part of the world – government and opposition and others - and this needs to stop,” Ryan said.

Community engagement strategy involved healthworkers visiting a village in advance of vaccination, but by the time they went back the next morning or afternoon, youth groups or others were often there to intercept them.

“It’s not the family who are rejecting, it’s other elements in the community who have been organized to respond to the ‘outsiders’, be they government or NGOs or others, and that has caused a lot of flashpoints with the teams.”

Ryan said the problem was totally different from attacks on health facilities by armed insurgents, who had used “heavy arms fire, rocket-propelled grenades, and other stuff”, which he said had horrified local inhabitants.

To try to improve access for healthworkers, there had been discussions with Congo’s president and opposition leaders, as well as the bishop of Butembo, imams and tribal chiefs who wield political influence. But a truly “all society approach” was needed, “or this situation will get even worse”, Ryan said.",no result found

In other developments, South Korea today announced a plan to provide $500,000 in humanitarian aid for the Ebola response, and a group that analyzes humanitarian events warned that increasing attacks near the Ebola-hit DRC areas could displace more people and ease the spread of the disease.

Case confirmed in new health zone

The fifteen new cases were from seven different locations, including Alimbongo, a newly affected health zone in North Kivu province, the ministry said in its daily update. It added that an extensive investigation is under way to identify where the patient contracted the virus. The new cases increase the outbreak total to 1,720, and authorities are still investigating 293 suspected Ebola cases.

One of the new illnesses involves a health worker who was vaccinated less than 10 days ago, before the immune system can protect against the virus. So far, 102 health workers have been sickened in the outbreak.

Twelve more people died from Ebola, four in community settings and eight in Ebola treatment centers. The developments push the fatality count to 1,136.

The ministry also said the triage area at Katwa General Reference Hospital was vandalized by unknown assailants at 2 am this morning.

The ministry said the attackers threw rocks then set fire to some tarps.

Today's security incident follows an attempted militia assault yesterday on Katwa's Ebola treatment center—also in the early morning hours—that killed one of the attackers but caused no damage to the facility.

Korean funds will help support response

In a statement, South Korea said the $500,000 in cash assistance will help fund the response plan developed by the DRC's health ministry along with 15 international organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO). It added that with DRC's outbreak pushing into its 10th month, the international community's engagement and support is all the more needed.

The donation isn't South Korea's first for Ebola. In 2014 the country sent a disaster relief team to help with West Africa's Ebola outbreak and in 2018 it provided $1.5 million to the WHO's emergency fund to help address Ebola in the DRC.

Security threats, population displacements

Since May, attacks and clashes between armed groups and security forces have displaced more than 12,000 people in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, which adds to more than 100,000 who were displaced from North Kivu province in April, according to an update today from ACAPS, a Norwegian nonprofit nongovernmental group that provides independent humanitarian analysis.

The group warned that attacks, especially by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), have increased in recent months and are likely to spark more displacement and boost humanitarian needs in North Kivu province. And they note that the increased attacks come at a time when Ebola transmission is increasing.

Displacement in Ebola-affected territories could fuel the spread of the disease, including the possibility that some people may slip across the border to Uganda without screening, heightening the threat of spread to other countries.

ACAPS said that, although most Ebola cases are concentrated in the Katwa, Butembo, and Beni areas, some health zones that have received displaced people have reported some Ebola cases, such as Kayna health zone in North Ituri province. However, it notes that the short-term, localized displacements common in the eastern DRC make it hard to not only gauge the risk of spreading the disease but also assess the needs of communities.

The new cases raise the outbreak total to 1,739, including 1,147 deaths. A total of 332 suspected cases are still under investigation. Six of the newly recorded deaths occurred in the community, raising the risk of further transmission.

Vaccination stopped for 5 days

In a situation update published yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the recent spike in cases as part of a ""stop and go"" pattern that's come to define this outbreak.

""Particularly in Butembo and Katwa, response has been reduced to a 'stop and go' pattern, where a day or two of activity is followed by a day or two of suspended or limited activity,"" the WHO said. ""Meanwhile, security measures have been strengthened at many healthcare facilities to aid the resumption of critical healthcare services.""

In the 3-week period between Apr 22 and May 12, 343 confirmed cases were reported, with 30% in Katwa, 13% each in Mandima and Mabalako, and 12% in Butembo. These hotspots have been the epicenter of virus activity since January.

The overall case-fatality ratio for this outbreak is 66%. Of the confirmed cases with known age and sex, 56% are female and 29% are children under the age of 18. The number of healthcare workers infected remains 101 (6% of total cases).

The WHO also released new details about a case contact from Beni who traveled to Kampala, Uganda on May 5, when he was on his 7th day of follow-up surveillance.

As of May 8 the man was safely returned to Beni where he will remain until contact tracing is complete. So far, he does not have any symptoms of Ebola.

A total of 14,459 case contacts are currently under surveillance as of May 12, the WHO said, with follow-up rates of around 84%.

The WHO also confirmed vaccination efforts were halted for 5 days recently in Butembo, Katwa, Kalunguta, Vuhovi, Lubero and Masereka health zones following the uprising of motorcycle taxis, which blocked roads, but has resumed in Butembo and Katwa, and continues in Mabalako, Beni, and Mandima.

Today, the DRC confirmed 116,233 people have been vaccinated with Merck's VSV-EBOV since August.

Experts express concern over violence

A feature of this outbreak has been the continued attacks on health care and response workers, which is part of a rising global trend, according to the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition 2018 report.

Last year, 167 health workers died in conflict settings across the globe and at least 710 were injured in more than 900 targeted attacks, up from 701 attacks reported in 2017.

The report is based on data collected from the WHO and the United Nations, and was published today in the British Medical Journal.

Ron Klain, the United States Ebola czar during the West African outbreak, said yesterday at the Pandemic and Biosecurity Forum in Washington, DC, that the WHO's response is inadequate in this type of violent setting.

""If the biggest problems we have right now in the DRC are security, instability, the attacks on health care workers, the attacks on responders, the community resistance — and that community resistance is violent and dangerous — the WHO has no capacity to respond to that,"" Klain said, according to a news story on Devex, a global development media platform.

Klain has suggested a ""white-helmeted security battalion"" be employed to protect health workers.

The WHO also concluded its situation report in a somber tone, acknowledging the difficulty of the outbreak.

""The continued increase in the number of new EVD cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is worrying, as there appears to be no end in sight to the difficult security situation, complicated by the challenging political environment,"" the WHO said.

May 15 BMJ study",no result found,no result found,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Documented attacks on health workers in conflict areas increased dramatically last year, endangering both children waiting for polio vaccines and efforts to contain the latest outbreak of Ebola, research showed on Wednesday.

Last year 973 attacks were reported on health workers in nearly two dozen conflict-ridden countries, killing 167 workers, according to the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition, a collection of global groups aimed at protecting them.

The violence, from bombings, burnings and armed takeovers of hospitals and clinics to attacks on ambulances and kidnappings, injured 710 health workers, it said.

The number of documented attacks rose significantly from the 701 reported attacks, also in 23 countries, in 2017, it said.

But the coalition cautioned that it was unclear if the higher number reflected more attacks or higher reporting after the World Health Organization (WHO) implemented a standardized system for collecting data on attacks last year.

Workers administering vaccines were attacked in six countries - Afghanistan, Central African Republic (CAR), Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan, Somalia and Sudan - blocking children from getting polio immunizations, it said.

Six vaccination workers were killed, and six were injured, it said.

The countries with the most reported attacks on health workers in 2018 were the occupied Palestinian territories with 308 and Syria with 257, followed by Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya and CAR.

The number of reported incidents rose in Cameroon, Libya, the occupied Palestinian territories and Yemen from 2017 and dropped in Iraq and South Sudan.

Of critical significance were attacks on health workers in northeastern Congo that forced many clinics to close temporarily, the coalition said in its report.

The violence poses “a great threat to containing the spread of the Ebola virus,” it said, by hindering efforts to trace those coming in contact with the virus and heightening the risk that it spreads.

“The violence is directly connected to the inability to get the epidemic under control,” said Leonard Rubenstein, chairman of the coalition and faculty member at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

“It’s an unrecognized problem,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Anybody concerned with global health needs to ... recognize what a threat this is to people all around the world and to us as well when epidemics can’t be stopped because of violence.”

The epidemic has moved through northeastern Congo, killing 1,117 people since mid-2018, the WHO said on Tuesday.

In the 23 countries studied, the attackers included government forces, foreign government forces, religious extremists and armed rebel groups, the coalition said.

Violence and threats in Afghanistan forced 140 clinics to close between June 2017 and June 2018, leaving an estimated two million people without access to healthcare, it found.

In Libya, Yemen and in northern Nigeria, more than half of the health facilities are either closed or no longer fully functioning, it said.",no result found
16-May-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

Although the security situation has subsided mildly into an unpredictable calm, the transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) continues to intensify in North Kivu and Ituri provinces with more than 100 confirmed cases reported this week.

The main drivers behind the continued rise in cases stems from insecurity hampering access to critical hotspot areas, persistent pockets of poor community acceptance and hesitation to participate in response activities, and delayed detection and late presentation of EVD cases to Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs)/Transit Centres (TCs).

Of particular concern are the community deaths resulting from the culmination of these factors. Community deaths denote all EVD (confirmed and probable) cases who died outside of an ETC/TC. This includes cases who die at home, as well as those who die within public/private hospitals and other health centres. On average, community deaths comprise approximately 40% of cases reported each week. This proportion fluctuates on a weekly basis, ranging from 28% to 43% of cases since the beginning of April after peaking as high as 71% in February. Of the total deaths (1147) currently listed in surveillance systems, approximately two thirds (68%) occurred outside of ETCs. Many of the patients who arrive at ETCs, often do so in a severe condition with a poor prognosis, and subsequently die shortly after admission. Community deaths also pose a major transmission risk as these cases have spent more time in the community while symptomatic and remain highly infectious at the time of their death and thereafter; propagating EVD to other members of the community such as family members and healthcare workers.

Despite the continued increase in EVD cases, it should be noted that transmission remains most intense in seven main hotspot areas: Katwa, Mabalako, Mandima, Butembo, Musienene, Kalunguta, and Beni. Collectively, these health zones account for the vast majority (93%) of the 350 cases reported in the last 21 days between 24 April – 14 May 2019 (Figure 1 and Table 1). A new case was also reported in the health zone of Alimbongo this week with links to cases deriving from Katwa. Current transmission patterns also illustrate the challenges resulting from cases originating from hotpot health zones and re-introducing the virus to areas where transmissions have previously been successfully halted. During this period, new cases were reported from 91 health areas within 18 of the 22 health zones affected to date (Figure 2).

As of 14 May, a total of 1739 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 1147 died (case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 56% (974) were female and 30% (514) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 102 (6% of total cases). Of the EVD patients who received care at ETCs, 459 have been successfully discharged.

Risk communication and community engagement teams continue to spread messages about the importance of seeking care early at healthcare facilities for an increased chance of survival. These messages have been particularly effective in Beni, where affected individuals have been reporting to the ETCs more frequently and more rapidly after onset of symptoms. The risk communication and community engagement actors have been instrumental in mediating instances of reluctance and resistance at the community level to ensure peaceful agreements are reached and that other pillars of the response such as vaccination, infection prevention and control (IPC), and safe and dignified burials (SDB) are able to carry out their respective response activities.

It is anticipated that the rising case figures will continue within the hotspot areas in the coming weeks given the resumption of most major response activities, which will lead to the detection of more cases. The increased transmission rates witnessed recently continue to demonstrate a heightened risk of EVD spreading to other neighbouring provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to surrounding countries.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, especially over the past four weeks, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. Renewed efforts and honing of security mitigation measures, addressing procedural, operational and physical security means to ensure staff safety and security are undertaken. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigate local spread. These efforts must continue to be scaled-up at this time.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

For more information, please see:",Ebola Situation on Thursday 16 May 2019 A total of 1760 cases 1672 confirms and 88 probable 1161 deaths and 46 hours of sickness,One of the very very many problems plaguing the North Kivu Ebola outbreak is it isnt one outbreak Its a numb httpstcoZBsdrh27h7,"Security problems have eased a bit into an ""unpredictable calm,"" as the outbreak continues to intensify, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today, as Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) health officials reported 21 more cases.

In other developments today, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)—a group that plays a key role in safe and dignified burials—said urgent help is needed from the international community before the outbreak escalates further.

And a study on the blood of Ebola survivors detailed how antibodies continue to evolve, months after hospitalization, findings that could help fine-tune vaccines and treatments.

New cases lift outbreak total 1,760

The 21 newly confirmed cases reported today are in eight locations, including 7 in Mabalako, 4 in Katwa, 3 in Musienene, 2 in Beni, 2 in Butembo, and 1 each in Mandima, Vuhovi, and Kalunguta.

The illnesses push the overall outbreak total to 1,760, as health officials investigate 310 suspected cases.

Fourteen more people died from Ebola, seven in community settings and seven in Ebola treatment centers. The fatality count now stands at 1,161.

Concerns about community deaths

In its weekly update today, the WHO said it's especially concerned about community deaths, which make up about 40% of new cases each week. Of 1,147 total deaths reported in the outbreak so far, 68% occurred outside of Ebola treatment centers, meaning patients died at a time when they are most infectious in homes or in health facilities not adequately equipped to isolate and treat patients sickened by the virus.

Such deaths directly result from the main drivers of continued cases, the WHO said, including insecurity that hampers access to critical hot spots, persistent pockets of community resistance, hesitation to participate in response activities, and delayed detection and late presentation of Ebola patients to Ebola treatment centers.

The WHO said transmission is most intense in seven main hot spots: Katwa, Mabalako, Mandima, Butembo, Musienene, Kalunguta, and Beni, which taken together account for 93% of the 350 cases reported over the past 21 days.

The new case reported in Alimbongo this week is linked to Ebola transmission in Katwa, according to the WHO.

In one glimmer of hope amid a bleak situation, the WHO said risk communicators working hard to spread messages about how important it is to seek early care to boost the chance of surviving Ebola are making an impact in Beni. Infected people in that area have been coming to Ebola treatment centers more often and more quickly after symptom onset.

Cases in hot spots will likely continue in the coming weeks, as most response activities resume after a string of security setbacks, the WHO said. The agency warned that increased transmission rates raise the risk of Ebola spreading to other parts of the DRC and to surrounding countries.

Red Cross warns of insecurity, underfunding

In a statement today, Emanuele Capobianco, MD, MPH, the IFRC's director of health and care, said the Ebola response faces a ""double jeopardy"" of insecurity and critical underfunding. He said the security situation is complex and will require a range of responses including increased community engagement, ""However, the funding situation could be fixed. We need more investment now.""

Capobianco said the world can't afford for Ebola to become entrenched in the outbreak provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, and the virus can't be allowed to spread to urban areas where it will be harder to contain or to cross international borders.

He said IFRC's work with safe and dignified burials is painstaking but successful. And in areas where Red Cross community engagement volunteers have been able to work, requests for safe burials have increased sharply, with more than 5,000 requested since the outbreak began and a success rate averaging 80%.

Survivor study details antibody evolution

The detailed study of antibodies produced by Ebola survivors was based on blood samples of four Ebola responders who got sick while working in West Africa's outbreak and were treated at Emory University Hospital in 2014. A team from Emory, Stanford University, the University of Wisconsin, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the US Army published its findings today in an early online edition of Cell.

The scientists found that high levels of neutralizing antibodies—thought to play a key role in protection—didn't appear in patients' blood until months after they left the hospital. The antibodies they identified might help establish a benchmark of immune protection after vaccination and guide the design of therapies and vaccines.

Duration of protection from the vaccine and how to gauge protection have been unclear, with some studies suggesting that neutralizing antibodies decline several months after vaccination.

Carl Davis, PhD, postdoctoral fellow at Emory Vaccine Center and the study's first author, said in an Emory press release that what researchers saw after tracking how antibodies evolved in the survivors is different than after vaccination. ""We did not previously appreciate how long it takes to get to an optimal antibody response after infection,"" he added.

When the four patients were acutely sick, they produced abundant antibodies that bound to Ebola virus proteins, but high neutralizing antibody production didn't kick in for several months. The researchers said that, over time, antibodies changed the parts of the virus they targeted and how tightly they bound to them. Regions of the antibodies that recruited other immune components also continued to evolve.

Of the four Ebola patients treated at Emory, two got very sick and a third was even sicker, requiring renal replacement therapy and respiratory support.

Davis said, ""What was unexpected is that we saw a lot of similarity between the four people, in terms of their antibody responses.""

The Ebola outbreak raging in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where health workers are under attack, is challenging the globe’s capacity to respond. It is also calling into question whether the use of a major weapon intended to address such health crises might be futile in this case.

Despite the gravity of the situation, the North Kivu outbreak hasn’t been declared a public health emergency of international concern — a PHEIC in global health parlance. That fact has frustrated some health security experts, who insist it’s long past time to proclaim an international emergency.

Other experts argue, however, that labeling this outbreak a global health crisis would not help to halt spread of Ebola in the region. They worry that it could even make an already perilous situation worse.

“I do not see what a PHEIC is going to add,” said Ilona Kickbusch, director of the global health center at the Graduate Institute of International Development Studies in Geneva.

“If you say it’s supposed to trigger a call to action and international attention, that’s already happening. If it’s supposed to trigger coordination, that’s already happening. If it’s supposed to trigger international response and monies, that’s already happening,” Kickbusch said. “There’s not enough money … but that, per se, is not going to resolve the problem. You don’t stop a war with money.”

The outbreak, which likely began in late April of 2018, was recognized as Ebola in late July. On Aug. 1 the World Health Organization declared that an outbreak in North Kivu was underway.

In the intervening months, the Congolese health ministry, the WHO, and a range of NGO partners have struggled to stop the spread of the virus. Their efforts have been hamstrung by the fact that this outbreak is occurring in a highly populous part of the country that has been a conflict zone for decades.

As of Sunday, there had been 1,705 cases and more than 1,124 deaths, making this the second-largest Ebola outbreak on record.

In the autumn, response teams found themselves caught in the crossfire when insurgents attacked government forces or United Nations peacekeepers in the region. But in recent months, the Ebola response workers have been the target of repeated violent aggression; at least three health workers have been killed.

The response is the subject of dangerous rumors spread on social media — that Ebola doesn’t exist, or that the response workers brought it to the region. In recent days pamphlets have been disseminated giving the response workers an ultimatum: Stop the epidemic and leave the region within days, or else.

Twice Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, has convened a meeting of outside experts to advise him on whether the outbreak should be declared a PHEIC. Both times, in October and again in April, the so-called emergency committee has concluded that the epidemic, while highly concerning, is not a global health emergency. That decision was based on the fact that, so far, the disease has not spread across Congo’s borders to start transmission in neighboring countries.

Tedros, as the WHO director general is called, has heeded the advice against the declaration of an emergency.

The chairman of the emergency committee convened in April, Dr. Robert Steffen, acknowledged at a press conference at the time that the WHO is having trouble raising money to finance the outbreak response, and declaring a PHEIC might open additional pockets.

But Steffen said that’s not a good enough reason to declare an emergency. “It would be not appropriate to declare a PHEIC just to generate funds,” he said.

More funds and more responders might actually increase the danger, said Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. Already some of the violence has been motivated by money, with some people complaining that the WHO is actually profiting from the outbreak.

“Having a lot of non-North Kivu, non-DRC other nationalities — at the moment I think that could easily inflame the situation and it could get completely out of control from a violence perspective,” Farrar said.

The region is rife with armed militia groups, some of which finance their operations by kidnapping aid workers for ransom. “The more money, the more kidnapping possibilities,” he said. “You could make the situation significantly worse.”

Farrar acknowledged that if the choice had been his, he probably would have declared this outbreak a public health emergency, but he doesn’t think it would make a material difference on the ground.

“I think it’s a bit of a red herring in a way,” he said.

Another problem with declaring a PHEIC has been seen in other instances where the tool was used. The International Health Regulations — a treaty designed to combat health threats — stipulate that countries should not penalize nations that disclose they have a dangerous disease outbreak by imposing travel or trade restrictions on the affected country. In reality, many have used the declaration of a PHEIC to do just that.

Many countries cut off visas for people from Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola crisis. A number of international airlines stopped flights to those countries, making it much more difficult for response workers and crucial supplies to get into the region. That could happen again.

“The main challenges on the ground are the insecurity and the community reluctance, fueled by conspiracy theories. A PHEIC declaration will not change that; it’s not a magic wand,” said Dr. Preben Aavitsland, Norway’s former state epidemiologist, who was among the experts who drafted a revision of the International Health Regulations in 2005 that created the PHEIC instrument.

“We know all too well the probable side effects of a PHEIC declaration: unfounded travel and trade restrictions. This may both hamper the response work and severely affect the local economy, thus increasing the community resistance,” said Aavitsland. He was a member of the WHO’s Ebola emergency committee that met in April, but said the views he shared with STAT were his own.

David Fidler, director of the Center on American and Global Security at Indiana University, said he believes it is inappropriate to hold off declaring a PHEIC because of fears of it might turn out to be unhelpful or counterproductive.

“Those concepts are highly subjective and not clearly anchored in public health principles and scientific data — the things at the heart of what a PHEIC analysis under the [International Health Regulations] is to be,” Fidler said.

He, too, suspects declaring this outbreak a global health crisis would not solve the problem. But he is concerned the debate over whether to declare a PHEIC in this case is undercutting the credibility of the tool.

“In this outbreak, we have seen this massive gap between experts dismissing its relevance and other experts insisting that calling a PHEIC is critical to managing this outbreak,” Fidler said. “This controversy has the potential to bring the PHEIC power, and the IHR more generally, into disrepute.”

Kickbusch agreed some clarification or shoring up of the International Health Regulations and the PHEIC tool is needed, but now is not the time to undertake that work.

“In the present political situation, I don’t think anyone should reopen any international document at all,” she said. “It’s much, much too risky.”"

May 17 DRC report

Study: Older age, high viral load associated with yellow fever deaths

A study published yesterday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases tracked the clinical outcomes of 76 Brazilian patients with yellow fever to establish predictors of mortality and found older age, elevated neutrophil count, and higher viral load all tied to higher death rates.

Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne virus with a 30% case-fatality rate. For the past 2 years Brazil has reported increased yellow fever transmission in a number of states; between January 2016 and June 2018, officials recorded 2,153 confirmed cases and 744 deaths in the country.

To conduct the study, researchers recruited 76 patients with lab-confirmed yellow fever treated at two tertiary hospitals in Sao Paolo City from January through May of 2018. Twenty-seven (36%) of the patients died within 2 months of hospital admission.

The authors found that all 11 patients with neutrophil counts of 4,000 cells per milliliter (mL) or greater and viral loads of 5.1 log 10 copies/mL or greater died (95% confidence interval, 72% to 100%). Most of the patients who died were also men and older than 45 years.

""Identification of poor outcome markers could help guide resource allocation and strategies to provide intensive care for patients with potentially severe disease, supporting a rational approach during disease outbreaks,"" the authors concluded. The study was funded by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation.

In his keynote speech to mark the opening of the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva today, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, praised the DRC health minister and its government for their leadership and commitment to ending the outbreak, but added that the risk of spread beyond the two affected provinces remains very high.

""We are fighting one of the world's most dangerous viruses in one of the world's most dangerous areas,"" Tedros said, emphasizing that outbreak responders are also battling insecurity, violence, misinformation, mistrust, and politicization of the event.

He said he has met with the DRC's president and opposition leaders to press for a multipartisan approach for ending the outbreak. ""Unless we unite to end this outbreak, we run the very real risk that it will become more widespread, more expensive, and more aggressive.""

Gavi gives $9 million more for vaccination

Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, announced today that it has provided $9.2 million more to support Ebola vaccination in the DRC's outbreak region.

In a news release, it said the new funding will go to the WHO to cover operating costs for vaccination, including vaccination teams, transportation, syringes and other supplies, and special refrigerators that keep the vaccine at the required temperature. Merck is donating the vaccine on a compassionate use basis.

Seth Berkley, MD, Gavi's chief executive officer, said in the release that evidence so far suggests the highly effective vaccine is making an impact on the ground. ""However, it is a sad fact that this impact has only been possible thanks to the sheer bravery of the vaccinators working in areas of increasing instability.""

In its latest update, the DRC said nearly 120,000 people had been vaccinated against Ebola, and Gavi said nearly 30,000 frontline and health workers have been immunized in the outbreak region. The same two groups of professionals in neighboring areas in Goma, South Sudan, Uganda, and Rwanda are also being vaccinated, and Burundi is preparing to begin vaccination soon.

Gavi's new funding will run until July, bringing its support since the outbreak began to $15.1 million, which includes $2 million for efforts in neighboring countries.

New cases alongside attacks

Alongside reports of new cases over the weekend, the DRC's health ministry in its May 18 update described two separate attacks on safe and dignified burial teams. In one, the chief of a burial team was assaulted by the family members of a person who died in the Rwampara/Bunia area who refused to let the team take samples from the body for testing.

On May 17 a burial team was assaulted while burying four people who died at the Ebola treatment center in Butembo. The teams dig the graves beforehand to streamline their work, but sometimes people cover the graves during the night to state their opposition to the burials. When the team arrived at the cemetery, the graves were covered and people threw stones at them, injuring a burial team officer.

In a pair of weekend updates, the health ministry reported 39 new cases in nine locations, with Butembo and Mabalako the hardest-hit areas, with 9 cases each. Other affected sites are Katwa (6), Beni (5), Musienene (3), Mandima (3), Kalunguta (2), Lubero (1), and Mangurujipa (1). As of yesterday, health officials were still investigating 291 suspected Ebola cases.

The health ministry also reported that 32 more people died from their Ebola infections, 19 of them in community settings and 13 in Ebola treatment centers.

The weekend developments pushed the outbreak total past 1,800 to reach 1,816. And yesterday, the number of fatalities topped 1,200 to reach 1,209.

Today the WHO's online Ebola dashboard reflected 10 more cases, which puts the overall total at 1,826.

This is the third attack in the past few days on safe and dignified burial teams working in North Kivu and Ituri provinces during the world's second largest Ebola outbreak in history.

Outbreak total climbs to 1,847

In addition to the attack on the burial team, officials in the DRC said another health worker in Mabalako — vaccinated less than 10 days ago — is among newly confirmed cases. This raises the total number of health workers infected during the outbreak to 103, including 34 deaths.

Officials will likely confirm 21 new cases of Ebola today, raising outbreak total to 1,847. As of yesterday, there were 1,218 deaths in this outbreak, and another 245 suspected cases still under investigation.

Recent cases are still occurring in virus hotspots, including Katwa, Mabalako, Kalunguta, Beni, and Butembo.

Arson threats to Masereka health facilities

The World Health Organization (WHO) regional office for Africa said in a new bulletin that 24% of all confirmed Ebola cases in the past 3 weeks has been in Katwa, and 18% in Mabalako.

From May 12 to May 18, officials confirmed 136 new Ebola cases, with an additional 92 deaths, demonstrating the continued transmission of the virus in the DRC.

More troubling, the WHO notes that some healthcare providers in Masereka health zone facilities are so scared for their safety due to arson threats, they have stopped wearing personal protective equipment and are reluctant to institute infection prevention and control practices.

""Numbers of new EVD [Ebola virus disease] cases in North Kivu and Ituri provinces continue to increase. Some of this weekly increase may be accounted for by inability to identify cases during periods of unrest,"" the WHO said. ""However, the situation remains extremely serious.""

Meanwhile, the country's health ministry was poised to report 19 new cases today, according to the latest information from the WHO's online Ebola dashboard.

Situation still 'highly unpredictable'

The WHO said that last week saw a drop in the number and severity of security incidents, and responders were able to conduct most of their activities as planned. ""However, despite this short lull, the situation remains highly unpredictable,"" it said.

Threats to response teams and facilities continue, particularly in Butembo and Katwa, but armed groups are present in smaller hot spots, and direct threats against Ebola response teams are on the rise, including leaflets and intimidation of local health workers who are collaborating with response teams. The uncertain settings include Lubero, Kalungunta, Mabalako, Masereka, and Komanda.

Echoing a concern raised yesterday in the WHO African regional office update, the WHO said another concern is that health workers are refusing to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) in health facilities and are performing only routine infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, based on violent threats from community members.

For example, in Masereka, threats to burn down health facilities prompted health providers in some locations to avoid wearing PPE or to institute IPC practices.

For the week ending May 19, 121 new confirmed cases were reported, mostly in Mabalako, Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Katwa, Mandima, and Musienene health zones.

Cases climb to 1,866

The 19 new cases reflected in the WHO's online Ebola dashboard raise the outbreak total to 1,866 cases, including 1,778 confirmed and 88 listed as probable. The number of deaths stands at 1,223.

In an update from the DRC's health ministry covering yesterday's developments, officials said a health worker from Masereka is among the slew of new cases, raising the number of infections in that group to 104, including 34 deaths.

The report said the health worker had been vaccinated, but did not say how long ago he or she had been immunized. Typically, it takes 10 days for protection from the vaccine to kick in.

In other related developments yesterday, Canada's United Nations delegation yesterday announced a $1 million contribution to the WHO's contingency fund for emergencies to help fight Ebola and other global health threats, according to a tweet from the group.

May 21 DRC update

WHO online Ebola dashboard

May 21 Canada UN Geneva tweet","Health officials have warned that the second-deadliest outbreak of Ebola may spiral out of control unless attacks by armed groups on medical facilities and workers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) stop.

Speaking to reporters in Geneva on Wednesday, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, the DRC's health minister, said the government of his country was struggling to contain the spread of the virus amid a spike in violent attacks against doctors and hospitals that were dangerously delaying the emergency response.

""The real emergency we face right now is security,"" Kalenga said on the sidelines of the World Health Assembly, which is under way this week in the Swiss city.

""Each time there is an attack on a health facility or medical personnel, the response to the epidemic is put on hold and we lose precious time to stop the virus from spreading further"".

'Complex health emergency'

Kalenga's comments highlighted growing concerns by the world's health authorities, who fear a new pandemic just three years after the last outbreak in West Africa killed more than 11,000 people between 2014 and 2016.

""We are fighting one of the world's most dangerous viruses in one of the world's most dangerous areas,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), told health ministers on Monday.

""This outbreak is one of the most complex health emergencies any of us have ever faced.

""Unless we unite to end this outbreak, we run the very real risk that it will become more widespread, more expensive and more aggressive.""

Violence, mistrust

Intercommunal violence has afflicted eastern DRC for decades, with a number of armed groups operating across a region that has historically been neglected by the central government in the capital, Kinshasa. The situation has worsened over the past years, creating hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people and almost a million refugees in neighbouring countries, according to the UN's refugee agency.

In addition to violent attacks, medical workers' efforts to contain the spread of the disease have been hampered by widespread community distrust of health agencies and institutions. A recent study by the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal showed that more than 30 percent of respondents believed that the virus was fabricated for the financial gain of local elites or to cause further destabilisation.

For his part, Kalenga dismissed the suggestion that the attacks may hide a political agenda.

""I think these are just spoilers in some of the provinces who want to see the government's response to the epidemic fail,"" he said. ""I don't think there is a clear agenda behind these attacks but the security agencies are studying the situation"".

Vaccination campaigns

Since the start of the outbreak in eastern DRC's North Kivu in August last year, at least 1,223 people have died out of 1,847 confirmed Ebola cases, Kalenga said. Thirty percent of those who died were children, according to WHO figures.

The transmission remains most intense in seven hotspot areas: Katwa, Mabalako, Mandima, Butembo, Musienene, Kalunguta and Beni. Kalenga said, however, that the Congolese authorities had been successful in containing the epidemic from spreading further.

Still, the growing number of assaults is discouraging people from reaching life-saving treatments and delaying the vaccinations campaigns, thus increasing the risk of transmission. In Butembo, vaccinations were taking place at the rate of 1,000 per day until an armed group killed a WHO doctor on April 19, bringing the vaccination campaign to a temporary stop.

According to UN figures, more than 130 attacks on health facilities have taken place since the start of the outbreak. Thirty-eight people, including civilians and health workers, have died as a result of these assaults.

The precarious security situation has forced Congolese to flee the country and heightened concerns about the possible cross-border spread of Ebola into Uganda, Zambia and Burundi.

Meanwhile, the main focus of the DRC's authorities remains prevention through vaccination and awareness campaigns run in accordance with local authorities and tribal leaders. Ten months into the outbreak, more than a 100,000 people have been vaccinated, Kalenga said.

The vaccine has proven successful in 97 percent of the cases. Twenty-five per cent of those vaccinated were at a very high risk of contagion.

The 2014–2016 outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone involved both urban and rural areas.

It was the deadliest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, ending with more than 28,600 cases and 11,325 deaths.",no result found,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo called on Wednesday for Merck’s experimental Ebola vaccine to be fully licensed to facilitate its use in the Ebola-hit country, while saying Johnson & Johnson’s rival drug would complicate matters.

Both vaccines are experimental drugs that can be used under strictly controlled research protocols but Merck’s has been used throughout the outbreak and has proven highly effective, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.

Congolese Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga told reporters in Geneva that the government would roll out a “geographic ring” vaccination strategy in the coming days.

“You do not only vaccinate the people in the household,” he said. “You have to consider the household as the case and then vaccinate all the households around the case.”

The virus has killed 1,223 of the 1,847 people who have fallen ill, making it the second-worst Ebola outbreak on record.

The new approach aims to protect people in an area where a new Ebola case is reported, irrespective of whether they have a known risk of contact with the patient, as is the case in the current “ring vaccination” approach.

“Somehow we have to catch up with the outbreak and break the transmission chain very quickly,” Ilunga said, adding that the new approach had already been used in a few remote villages.

He preferred to use just one vaccine.

“It would perturb the population to be faced with several different types of vaccines and that would muddle the message, and, as you know in a complex outbreak response, the message needs to be simple and clear,” he said.

Merck’s vaccine should be fully licensed as soon as possible to make it easier to use, he said.

“You must realize that all the 100,000 patients have been vaccinated according to a very strict protocol, with compliance, information, consent and so on, so it was not easy. If the vaccine is licensed, it would be easier.”

Merck’s licensing process is underway but it was unclear how long it would take, he said. Congo’s government had not discussed or requested the introduction of J&J’s vaccine.

Earlier this month, experts advising the World Health Organization recommended a dramatic expansion of vaccination, as well as introduction of the J&J treatment and a revised dosage of the Merck vaccine to ensure supplies last longer.",no result found
23-May-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

Although this past week continues to bear witness to a steady rise in the number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the overall security situation has allowed for the resumption of most response activities. While no major insecurity incidents have occurred, outbreak response teams, local healthcare workers, and community members cooperating with response efforts, are increasingly subjected to threats made against them by armed groups present in hotspot areas such as Katwa and Butembo. These threats are often disseminated through leaflets or direct intimidation. Armed groups’ presence, activities and increasing direct threats against response teams continue to be reported in other EVD affected areas, in particular Lubero, Masereka, Mabalako, Kalunguta, and Vuhovi, resulting in some healthcare workers being unwilling to don personal protective equipment or perform critical Infection Prevention Control (IPC) measures out of fear of violence being levied against them or the healthcare facilities where they operate.

During the past three weeks, reports indicate that transmission remains most intense in seven main hotspot areas: Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Katwa, Mabalako, Mandima, and Musienene. Collectively, these health zones account for the vast majority (93%) of the 349 cases reported in the last 21 days between 1 - 21 May 2019 (Figure 1 and Table 1). During this period, new cases were reported from 91 health areas within 15 of the 22 health zones affected to date (Figure 2).

As of 21 May, a total of 1866 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 1241 died (case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 56% (1051) were female and 30% (545) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 105 (6% of total cases). 490 EVD patients who received care at ETCs have been successfully discharged.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigated local spread. However, these efforts must continue to be scaled-up at this time.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

The UN appointed David Gressly, MBA, currently the UN's deputy special representative for peacekeeping missions in the DRC, to the post. Gressly is expected to work closely with the World Health Organization (WHO).

""The Ebola response is working in an operating environment of unprecedented complexity for a public health emergency—insecurity and political protests have led to periodic disruptions in our efforts to fight the disease,"" said Gressly in a WHO statement. ""Therefore, an enhanced UN-wide response is required to overcome these operating constraints, and this includes moving senior leadership and operational decision making to the epicenter of the epidemic in Butembo. We have no time to lose.""

Despite the liberal use of an effective vaccine, the current Ebola outbreak has proven difficult to manage, with an up-and-down transmission pattern caused by frequent violent attacks in the region. Additionally, community resistance to healthcare workers and response team members has made surveillance difficult.

The DRC will likely confirm 11 more new cases today, raising the outbreak total to 1,877, including 1,241deaths, according to the WHO's Ebola dashboard.

Yesterday, the DRC's ministry of health said another health worker had been infected in Katwa, the current epicenter of virus activity. The worker was unvaccinated.

The case raises to 105 the number of health worker affected by this outbreak. Healthcare workers represent 5.6% of Ebola cases in the DRC, and 35 have died.

DRC wants more Merck vaccine

As of yesterday, 121,868 people in the DRC and surrounding countries had been vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed VSV-ZEBOV vaccine, in a ring vaccination campaign that focuses on case contacts and contacts of contacts.

Yesterday, the DRC called for more of Merck's product—and asked that it be licensed—to continue vaccination efforts, rather than introduce Johnson & Johnson's Ebola vaccine into the outbreak setting.

According to Reuters, officials worry that introducing another new vaccine into the outbreak region may cause confusion. They also quoted DRC's Minister of Health Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, as saying that authorities will roll out a new ""geographic"" ring vaccination strategy.

""You do not only vaccinate the people in the household,"" he said. ""You have to consider the household as the case and then vaccinate all the households around the case.""

Kalenga said the new strategy could interrupt transmission chains quickly, and that by licensing VSV-ZEBOV, the vaccination process would be streamlined and faster.

Uganda to start Janssen vaccine trials

In other vaccine news, the Uganda Virus Research Institute will begin two human trials of Janssen Pharmaceutical Company's Ebola vaccine candidate in July. The vaccine has already been tested in the United Kingdom.

Healthy volunteers will be given two doses, a priming dose and a booster. According to All Africa, the vaccine contains strains from Ebola Zaire, Ebola Tai Forest, and Ebola Sudan viruses, as well as Marburg virus.

The drive to rein in the deadly virus has been hampered by attacks on treatment centers by armed groups operating in Congo’s lawless east as well as by distrust among local residents, many of whom view the disease as a conspiracy.

The outbreak has been contained in parts of Ituri and North Kivu provinces, but risks of spreading to other provinces and neighboring countries remain “very high”, the United Nations and World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement.

Officials address threats

In its daily update yesterday, the DRC's health ministry said nurses in Musienene health zone had a meeting yesterday to denounce death threats and destruction of health facilities over the past few days. The facilities were targeted over their participation in the Ebola response.

The nurses asked local authorities to take steps to tamp down the violent threats and said they will go on strike if the threats don't stop.

Also, the ministry said targeted violence in Beni and Lubero has led several doctors and nurses to move or temporarily leave their homes, forcing some health facilities to close their doors. It added that the worst area is Kyondo health zone, where Kyakumba Reference Health Center has been closed since May 21 owing to physician and nursing staff fearing for their safety.

Since Aug 1, 132 attacks against medical units have been reported, which has resulted in 38 injuries and 4 deaths in health workers and patients, the ministry said.

WHO highlights 7 hard-hit areas

The WHO's latest weekly overview of the outbreak yesterday said no major security incidents were reported in the past 7 days. However, outbreak workers, local health providers, and community members cooperating with the response have been increasingly subjected to threats—spelled out on leaflets or communicated directly—from armed groups present in epicenters such as Katwa and Butembo.

Also affected are smaller hot spots such as Lubero, Masereka, Mabalako, Kalunguta, and Vuhovi.

Regarding the continued steady rise in Ebola cases, the WHO said that over the past 3 weeks transmission is most intense in seven locations that have seen 93% of cases during that timeframe. They are Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Katwa, Mabalako, Mandima, and Musienene.

With Ebola response teams struggling to contain the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the World Health Organization and its partners can make changes to shore up their effort and try to prevent the crisis from escalating further, according to a handful of experts surveyed by STAT.

The experts are wary of criticizing WHO officials and others trying desperately to stop the virus from spreading. Violence aimed at Ebola response workers and a refusal to cooperate with control measures in some communities has rendered this outbreak, the second largest on record, unlike anything the world of Ebola responders has seen before. There have been repeated attacked on Ebola treatment centers, and on many days response workers have been unable to move about in outbreak hotspots.

At the same time, the experts believe global health officials have opportunities to bolster their efforts.

Here are three.

Good data are key

The foundation of any Ebola response is epidemiology. Knowing where the virus is spreading and who is in its path is crucial to bringing an Ebola epidemic under control. But from the earliest days of this outbreak, that’s been a problem.

“I don’t think there is a good record of what’s going on. I don’t think there’s a good database,” said Dr. Pierre Rollin, a veteran Ebola responder who retired earlier this year from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We’re just driving in the fog because we don’t have good data.”

Every single previous Ebola outbreak was stopped using the same techniques: find the cases and isolate them so they cannot infect more people. Figure out with whom they’ve had contact and monitor those people daily. If any of them become ill, isolate them and find their contacts. Bury the dead safely, so that funeral rituals don’t end up infecting more people.

In this outbreak, responders have had an additional tool: an experimental vaccine.

For this approach to work, though, the surveillance teams need to know in which social networks the Ebola virus is spreading. In this outbreak, that often hasn’t been the case. Significant numbers of the new cases were not previously on contact lists. Their health hadn’t been monitored and they weren’t offered vaccine because no one knew they had been exposed.

The impact of these unidentified chains of transmission appears to be growing as the outbreak expands. Since the beginning of May, only one-third of new cases were known contacts of a previous case. Only about half of those had agreed to be monitored to see if they were developing symptoms. Most had not agreed to be vaccinated.

Dr. Scott Dowell, deputy director for surveillance and epidemiology at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, shares concerns about the expanding number of unrecognized cases.

“I think there is very likely a large pool of unrecognized transmission out there and unidentified patients,” said Dowell, who worked for decades for the CDC and has worked a number of Ebola responses. “And it’s uncertain just how big that pool is. And also uncertain to me about whether the current response can get on top of it, which is really worrisome.”

Rollin, who is following the outbreak closely, is worried about the fact that so few probable cases are being added to the outbreak totals. Probable cases are people who had Ebola-like symptoms and who had contact with people who either were known cases or who also had what looked like Ebola. Often these are people who died and were buried without being tested for the disease, but for whom there is a high likelihood that they were infected.

Given how many people are refusing to cooperate with the Ebola response teams — staying home when they are sick, fighting off safe burial teams that try to test corpses — there should be a steady stream of probable cases, Rollin said. And yet they are rare. “So they’re missing a lot of cases,” he said.

Lab capacity needs to be increased

There are serious concerns that the existing laboratory capacity to test samples from suspected Ebola cases can no longer keep pace with the number of tests that need to be conducted.

DRC’s National Biomedical Research Institute — INRB — is overseeing the testing. Rollin and others fear the current needs exceed its capacity, leading to delays in getting test results.

“The lab is overwhelmed,” Rollin said.

Newsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:

If a laboratory can’t quickly process all the tests taken, it is effectively capping the number of new positive cases that can be found, said Dowell. It’s not that they aren’t there; it’s that the lab can’t pinpoint them in a timely manner. That leads to slowdowns in identifying the contacts of new cases and inviting them to be vaccinated. People who need vaccine may be vaccinated too late to prevent infection.

The delays in getting test results are also discouraging people from coming forward to be tested, said Dr. Axelle Ronsse, an emergency coordinator for the Belgian branch of Doctors Without Borders. Test results can sometimes take two or three days.

The Gates Foundation is urging the Congolese Ministry of Health and the WHO to start using rapid point-of-care tests that were developed after the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016, said Dowell, who noted these tests could greatly increase the number of people who are tested.

There’s a concern the tests could lead to some false negatives — people who are actually infected, but don’t test positive — Dowell admitted. But finding more infected people more quickly, even if it’s not all of them, should help, he said.

The lab capacity issue also extends to the sequencing of Ebola viruses, a technique that can be used to fill in information gaps of chains of transmission when, as with this outbreak, they occur.

Newly confirmed cases may not know where or how they became infected. But by comparing the sequence of their virus to the sequences of other cases, it can become clear that the infection occurred when two unrelated people were in a clinic on the same day, or that this patient likely infected that taxi driver.

INRB, the Congolese national lab, has been sequencing viruses. But the information it is finding isn’t always being shared in a timely way with the teams doing case surveillance. And capacity is an issue here as well. “As the number of daily positives has grown, the sequencing hasn’t nearly kept pace with those positives,” Dowell said.

A report to the World Health Assembly from a group that advises the WHO’s emergencies program hinted at insufficient use of the sequencing data, saying that “timely analysis of genetic sequencing data are critical to fully characterize the evolution of the [Ebola] outbreak in order to inform diagnostic, vaccine and treatment approaches.” It recommended “closer collaboration between INRB and WHO.”

If Ebola treatment centers are seen as toxic, find alternatives

In some communities, there remains deep-seated reluctance to go to Ebola treatment centers. Doctors Without Borders, which pioneered the current system of Ebola treatment centers, has suggested diversifying care options might help.

ETCs, as they are called, have become a place of stigma, associated with death. In fact, people who seek care in treatment centers quickly after the onset of symptoms have a higher chance of survival than those who eschew the centers — but that reality has not been recognized in the affected communities.

Doctors Without Borders has proposed that some hospitals in the outbreak zone be trained to treat Ebola patients safely — without posing a risk to their other patients — because the reality is that many people with Ebola symptoms turn to clinics or hospitals rather than ETCs.

Likewise, the group has urged the health ministry to consider allowing for some home care of Ebola patients, even suggesting that experimental Ebola drugs might be administered by a team of visiting health workers to some patients being cared for at home.

Ronsse said ETCs should remain the primary sites for care of Ebola patients. But with so many patients refusing to go for to them, finding ways to minimize the risk these patients present to the health workers who care for them in hospitals or family members in households could help reduce transmission. Recently the WHO reported that 68% of the people who have died from Ebola in this outbreak died in the community — at home or in a health facility that was not a treatment center.

“It’s something else we could do,” Ronsse explained. “But we cannot do only home-based care or only treatment at the level of the health center. We should have the three levels.”

Likewise, Ronsse said home care — which would involve training family members to take precautions and giving them protective equipment and cleaning materials — is not something that could be done on a large scale. “It’s really for the people who would not accept to come to the center,” she said."

""The outbreak could be stopped … but without a secure environment it's not possible,"" said Matshidiso Moeti, MBBS, MSc, WHO regional director for Africa, in a teleconference today.

Violent incidents have tripled

The past 5 months have seen 174 attacks on health clinics and health workers, alike, Moeti said. The attacks have caused 5 deaths and 51 documented injuries. When compared with the first 5 months of the outbreak, which began last August, that's a tripling of violence, she said.

Over the weekend, a community health worker near Mbalako was killed. The worker was trained to carry out response efforts in Vusahiro village. On the evening of the attack, three houses in the village were also burned.

The attacks are the sole reason the outbreak is not coming to an end, Moeti said, as each violent attack disrupts surveillance and vaccination efforts.

""The technical means to stop this Ebola outbreak are available, but without access, they can't be employed optimally,"" Moeti said.

This week David Gressly, MBA, who was appointed last week as the United Nation's Ebola czar, will create a new structure that could ""crack the code"" on violence, Moeti said. Gressly will arrive in Butembo tomorrow, and one of his key objectives is healthcare worker security.

Over the weekend, the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the DRC grew by 26 cases, passing the 1,900 case mark to a total of 1,920 cases, according to the DRC yesterday.

Among the 1,920 cases are 1,281 deaths and more than 500 survivors. As of yesterday, the DRC said 252 suspected cases are still under investigation, and 125,467 people had been vaccinated against the virus.

Nosocomial transmission drop; pop-up vaccination

While violent attacks are on the rise, Mike Ryan, MD, the WHO's executive director of emergency programs, highlighted some encouraging figures in the latest epidemiologic updates on the outbreak.

""Six or seven weeks ago, 35% of cases were nosocomial, meaning they contracted Ebola in the healthcare setting,"" said Ryan. ""In the last 21 days that rate has dropped to 16% and in the last week, 5%.""

Ryan said the goal is zero nosocomial transmission. He also touted the effectiveness of ""pop-up"" vaccination clinics and community health teams that are working on a ""zone-to-zone"" level in active outbreak regions.

""In Katwa, it's almost a cellular, street level of community engagement,"" Ryan said.

Katwa and Butembo are still the outbreak epicenters, and Ryan said the outbreak remains geographically contained. But even with certain wins, Ryan said he refused to speculate on the outbreak.

""We may still see another wave of cases,"" he said.

MSF questions surveillance efforts

Late last week, Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which pulled out of the region in February because of violence, issued a statement on the outbreak, suggesting that surveillance is not effective.

""More than 80 percent of new confirmed cases have not been identified as contacts. Additionally, as few as 32 percent of the new confirmed cases were linked back to known contacts. This means that the listing of contacts and surveillance are not effective,"" the statement said.

""This also mean that while the number of new cases being reported is high, the real number is likely to be even higher.""

Attacks on treatment centers by armed groups and mistrust among residents who view the disease as a conspiracy have become major impediments to containing Democratic Republic of Congo’s worst-ever Ebola outbreak.

The hemorrhagic fever has so far killed 1,281 people, according to the latest ministry figures, and shows no signs of slowing its spread, with dozens of new cases a week.

The ministry said that on Saturday residents of the village of Vusahiro, in the Mabalako district, “rose up and attacked the local Ebola response team, made up of village residents who were trained to carry out certain response activities”.

A hygienist from the infection prevention and control team died of his injuries when he was transferred to hospital, it said.

Responders, healthcare workers, and community members are increasingly subjected to threats from armed groups in hotspots such as Katwa and Butembo, the World Health Organization says, complicating efforts to contain Ebola.

U.N. officials say that stopping targeted attacks on health workers requires untangling deep-rooted political problems in eastern Congo. Dialogue has led to a recent reduction in large-scale attacks on health workers, WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday.

Still, an uphill battle remains. Between January and early May, there were 42 attacks on health facilities, with 85 workers either injured or killed, according to WHO figures from May 3.

Health workers have been attacked six times in the last eight days, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the closing session of the annual World Health Assembly in Geneva on Tuesday.

“These attacks demonstrate that the ongoing Ebola outbreak is more than a health crisis,” he said. “Ending it takes a coordinated and strengthened effort across the U.N. system...with strong leadership from the government.”",no result found

Meanwhile, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) health ministry yesterday reported 6 more cases, pushing the outbreak total to 1,926 cases.

Encouraging glimmers or ongoing fluctuations?

Part of the decline reflects fewer cases in Katwa, which has been the main Ebola epicenter over the past several weeks. At the same time, smaller hot spots such as Mabalako, Kalunguta, and Mandima are experiencing rising cases. For example, the WHO notes that Mabalako has reported 23% of newly confirmed cases over the past 3 weeks.

Aside from a drop in cases, the WHO said in its latest situation report that it sees other encouraging signs, including lower proportions of nosocomial (healthcare-related) infections and community deaths. Also, it said outbreak responders are reporting higher proportions of contacts registering when cases are detected.

It said, however, that weekly fluctuations in the indicators that health officials track have been reported in the past, and it's still not clear if the surveillance system has the ability to identify all new cases in areas with ongoing security problems.

""Operations are still regularly hampered by security issues, and the risk of national and regional spread remains very high,"" the WHO said.

New cases in 3 hot spots

In a daily update yesterday, the DRC's health ministry said the 6 new cases include 2 in Katwa, 2 in Butembo, and 2 in Mabalako.

The latest illnesses lift the outbreak total to 1,926 cases, which includes 1,832 confirmed and 94 probable infections. Health officials are still investigating 383 suspected cases.

Six more people died from Ebola, one of them a patient who died in a community setting in Katwa and five who died in Ebola treatment centers, including three in Butembo and two in Mabalako. Deaths now total 1,287.

In other outbreak region developments, health workers in Mabalako went on a 1-day strike on May 27 over claims that they weren't paid their bonuses in August and December. The ministry said there appears to have been a mix-up with nongovernmental organizations that were involved in managing the Mabalako treatment center and, adding that it's important to clarify transfer procedures when an agency leaves a health zone.

Officials note that discussion are still under way with the Mabalako sub-coordination office to assess the merits of the health workers' claims.

30-May-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

A decline in the number of confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases has been reported this week (22 to 28 May). Over the past seven days, a total of 73 new confirmed cases were reported compared to the previous where 127 new confirmed cases were reported. This should be interpreted with caution given the complex operating environment and fragility of the security situation. Katwa, one of the epicenters of the outbreak, reported fewer cases this week and other health zones such as Mabalako, Kalunguta and Mandima have also seen a decline in case reporting. Active transmission was reported in 14 of the 22 health zones that have been affected to date. Other initial encouraging findings such as a lower proportion of reported nosocomial infections, a lower proportion of community deaths and a higher proportion of registered contacts at case detection have also been reported. Weekly fluctuations in these indicators have been reported in the past and uncertainties remain with regards to the ability of the surveillance system to identify all new cases in areas faced with ongoing insecurity. Operations are still regularly hampered by security issues, and the risk of national and regional spread remains very high.

Mabalako reported 24% (73/309) of the new confirmed cases in the past 21 days. Nine out of the 12 Mabalako health areas have reported new confirmed cases during this period. In the 21 days between 8 to 28 May 2019, 83 health areas within 14 health zones reported new cases, representing 46% of the 180 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 309 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the Mabalako (24%, n=73), Butembo (21%, n=64), Katwa (14%, n=42), Beni (11%, n=34), Kalunguta (10%, n=31), Musienene (7%, n=23) and Mandima (6%, n=20) health zones.

As of 28 May 2019, a total of 1945 EVD cases, including 1851 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1302 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1208 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 1945 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 58% (1122) were female, and 29% (572) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 108 (6% of total cases).

All alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries continue to be monitored and investigated. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts outside the outbreak affected areas. On 3 June, a pilgrimage is planned to Namugongo, Uganda to commemorate the death of Catholics and Anglican martyrs. Preparedness activities surrounding the pilgrimage are ongoing.

EVD Cases in Under Five-Year Olds

WHO periodically conducts in-depth epidemiological analyses so that data can help reveal any gaps and drive evidence-based response improvements. An in-depth analysis of EVD cases in children under five-years of age demonstrated some noteworthy trends. As of 28 May, children under the age of five accounted for 15% (300/1949) of EVD cases reported, with children under one year of age accounting for 6% (118/1949). Of the 300 cases in children under the age of five, 19 were probable cases (19/94, 20% of all probable cases).

Data indicate that children under the age of five are being brought into healthcare facilities sooner than cases over the age of five (2.4 days vs. 3.2 days respectively), but most of these cases are not being referred to ETCs, and instead attend multiple local healthcare facilities. These cases visited on average 1.5 healthcare facilities, compared to 1.2 healthcare facilities for cases aged over five-years of age. These observations show that in general, parents are willing to seek medical attention for their children at healthcare facilities but are reluctant to bringing their children to ETCs, perhaps out of fear of being far from home and without the support of family members. More work needs to be done to reduce fear and misunderstanding of ETCs and to reduce any other barriers to access, with a special focus on this age group. All cases that may not be adequately isolated including children under five-years of age may pose a considerable transmission risk to healthcare workers, patients, and members of the community.

With regards to contact-tracing, 28% of EVD cases under five-years of age are registered as contacts, compared to 41% in cases over five-years of age. Although EVD cases under five years of age are less frequently listed as contacts, proportions of cases both below and over five-years of age are under surveillance remain similar (18% vs. 20% respectively). The reasons underlying these low figures are unclear at this time and further investigations are ongoing.

As of 28 May, the overall case fatality rate (CFR) of EVD cases in children under the age of five stands at 77%. This CFR was notably higher than that of EVD cases over five-years of age at 57%. These figures are in line with those observed in the 2014 West Africa EVD outbreak1 . There are a number of possible explanations for the higher CFR in this vulnerable population: the lower proportion of cases that present to ETCs, higher baseline mortalities in this population in general, and the inability to vaccinate cases who were not listed as contacts. Community deaths (i.e. any EVD deaths occurring outside of Ebola treatment centres/Transit centres (ETCs/TCs) account for 76% of deaths due to EVD in children under the age of five and 65% above the age of five. Of the community deaths of children under the age of five, 54% died in a healthcare facility.

As expected, the CFRs of EVD cases both younger and older than five-years of age (50% and 39% respectively) who sought treatment at ETCs is markedly lower than those who did not (86% and 68% respectively). The relative difference in CFRs between the two groups reduces upon admission into an ETC. This again reinforces the need to continue strengthening efforts to work with communities to encourage all affected populations, and in particular parents of young children, to seek treatment at ETCs as early as possible in order to give them the best chance of survival. Overall, the fact that these observed trends indicate that while it is promising to see lower CFRs in young children treated in ETCs, and to see that parents are willing to seek medical attention for their children at healthcare facilities, much emphasis needs to be made at improving contact listing of children under five years of age and encouraging parents to bring their children to be treated in ETCs. It must also be stressed that the proportions and resultant associations described above must be interpreted with caution given the often-limited demographic information available and are subject to change due to the fluid nature of the ongoing EVD outbreak.

Efforts are ongoing to encourage community-based facilities to refer suspected cases to ETCs/TCs, however these activities can be further strengthened. Children of all ages, including infants, that have suspected or confirmed EVD, are cared for at ETUs with specific optimized, supportive care protocols. Paediatric-specific equipment, medicines and trained specialists are available to provide clinical support at ETCs for this age group. All confirmed children are also rapidly enrolled in investigational therapeutic protocols after informed consent is obtained. Children receive nutritional care and psychosocial support from psychologists while at the ETC and are cared for 24/7 by care providers from survivors so they are not alone. As with all age groups, infants and young children are offered support via a specialized programme of care for Ebola survivors. In addition, pregnant women that have survived EVD are followed closely in the survivor program and return to ETCs for delivery by a multi-disciplinary team that has obstetric and paediatric expertise.

In light of these findings, UNICEF and WHO are working with partners in supporting activities related to nutritional care and psychosocial support of EVD patients, particularly for parents and children. These include supporting and providing information related to infant feeding for children separated from their parents or orphaned. UNICEF is working with EVD survivors and creating infant and young child feeding (IYCF) counselling support groups. They are also supporting the screening of malnourished children under two years old and their referral to Nutritional Units for assistance. Psychosocial support and material assistance are being conducted in outbreak areas where nurseries for children who have been separated from their mothers are set up and psychosocial support is provided to family members accompanying EVD affected persons and their contacts.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases has been ongoing since late February 2019. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigated local spread. However, these efforts must continue to be scaled-up at this time.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

For more information, please see:","Ebola Situation on Thursday May 30, 2019 In total 1954 cases 1860 confirms and 94 probable 1312 deaths and 52 httpstcopeEo4ySFx7",Ebola in little children WHO posted today a very interesting analysis of the pediatric Ebola infections in the N httpstcoQYbNegPTMB,"By early February 2019, transmission of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) Ituri province was largely under control, and declines were observed in Katwa and Butembo, several leading experts on the outbreak wrote yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).

But a sudden increase in violent attacks on healthcare workers and facilities throughout North Kivu province have caused the outbreak to spike in the last 2 months and become intractable.

The experts, including DRC Minister of Health Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, and the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional director, Matshidiso Moeti, MD, published a special report on the 10-month-long outbreak, the world's second largest.

""Numerous operational challenges posed by chronic insecurity are compounded by political tensions associated with contested national elections. Violence has increasingly been targeted at EVD response teams and facilities, exacerbating the spread of the virus,"" they said.

Today, Reuters reported that 26 members of a rebel group thought to be linked to the Islamic State were killed near Beni in a shootout with DRC military. The rebels are part of the Allied Democratic Forces, but the Islamic State is also claiming responsibility for the attack, which was directed against the Congolese army.

Need for political will to end outbreak

The authors of the NEJM report said though the outbreak officially began on Aug 1, 2018, in Ituri province, cases likely date back to April of that year. This was the first time Ebola was recorded in this part of the DRC, and most residents had never heard of the virus before: Malaria, diarrhea, and childhood diseases were the common illnesses among communities.

Nosocomial transmission likely played a large role in early transmission. Though the outbreak was quickly contained in Ituri province within 1 month, infected people traveling to Beni, Butembo, and Katwa, brought the disease to those locations.

Violence is what has allowed Ebola to continue. The authors produced a graph that shows how major times of unrest in the outbreak region have been followed by increased Ebola transmission, including a massacre in Beni, violent protests after the DRC's recent presidential election, and February's burning of Ebola treatment centers.

The authors concluded by saying that all the tools of outbreak control are in place, including an effective vaccine, surveillance means, and growing community engagement. But without political will, the outbreak will go on.

""The alignment of key political and armed groups behind the response effort is essential to stop the violence against health care and rehabilitate the humanitarian space required for outbreak control,"" the authors said.

Total now 1,945 cases, including 2 newly infected health workers

Yesterday the DRC's ministry of health confirmed 19 new cases of Ebola, raising the outbreak total to 1,945, including 1,302 deaths.

Fifteen new deaths were recorded yesterday, and 297 suspected cases are still under investigation. Of the 15 newly recorded deaths, 10 occurred in the community, which raises the risk of transmission.

There are now 108 health workers infected with the virus, including two newly diagnosed workers from Kalunguta and Mabalako. Both had been vaccinated. Thirty-six health workers have died during this outbreak.

Vaccination efforts continue, with a total of 126,565 people reached as of yesterday.

Lessons from West Africa outbreak

Yesterday in the Lancet, authors from the Ebola Gbalo Research Group published an article outlining lessons learned during the response to the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone in 2013-2015.

Community engagement was the key, they suggested, for successful response efforts.

""Burial teams and contact tracing worked best when the recruits were local,"" the authors wrote. ""Where local agents, including health personnel, government workers, and families, were strongly involved in planning and implementing the response it was more effective.""

The exchange in fire took place on Thursday in a village near the city of Beni, an area where more than a dozen different militia groups and associated armed gangs operate, and the epicentre of the Democratic Republic of Congo's worst-ever Ebola epidemic.

The army's spokesman for east Congo, General Leon-Richard Kasonga, said fighters from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) attacked a position in Ngite village and that soldiers returned fire and pursued them.

""Twenty-six rebels were neutralised by the army, and their bodies recovered,"" he told reporters in Goma.

The ADF has never claimed allegiance to ISIL, but witnesses said the Congolese group carried out an attack last month in nearby Bovata, which ISIL claimed.

ISIL described that attack as its first in what it called the ""Central Africa Province"" of the ""Caliphate"" - the name it gave to the area of Syria and Iraq that it controlled for several years from 2014.

The ADF arose in western Uganda in 1995 under the leadership of Jamil Mukulu, a Christian-turned-Muslim.

Forced out of Uganda, it operates in the border area in the DRC's North Kivu province, an area where other armed groups are also active.

It has been blamed for recruiting and using child soldiers, killing hundreds of civilians since 2014, as well as 15 Tanzanian peacekeepers who died in an attack in December 2017.

Rival armed groups remain active in pockets of east Congo long after the official end of a 1998-2003 war in which millions of people died, mostly from hunger and disease.

Insecurity around Beni is also undermining efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic, the second worst outbreak in history, which has killed close to 1,300 people since August.

In other outbreak developments, the DRC's health ministry in updates yesterday and today said Ebola has infected 29 more people, 1 of them a health worker who died from the disease.

Terrible toll on young children

The information on Ebola trends in children came from the WHO's weekly snapshot of the outbreak, posted yesterday, and it shows high deaths rates in the youngest patients. The WHO said drilling down into the epidemiologic data helps officials spot gaps in the Ebola response and points to possible evidence-based improvements.

Children younger than 5, as of May 28, have made up 15% of all Ebola cases, and, of 300 cases in the age-group, 19 are listed as probable.

Though children under 5 are brought to health facilities sooner than kids older than 5, most aren't being referred to Ebola treatment centers (ETCs), with parents opting to take them to multiple local healthcare facilities. The WHO said possible reasons for avoiding ETCs could be parents' fear of being far from home away from family support.

""More work needs to be done to reduce fear and misunderstanding of ETCs and to reduce any other barriers to access, with a special focus on this age group,"" the WHO said, adding that not isolating sick people—including kids younger than 5—poses a considerable transmission risk to health workers, patients, and the community.

In another key finding, the analysis showed that only 28% of kids younger than 5 were registered as contacts of earlier cases, compared with 41% of those older than 5. The WHO added that the percentage under surveillance for both groups is similar, at 18% and 20%, respectively. ""The reasons underlying these low figures are unclear at this time and further investigations are ongoing,"" it said.

When WHO scientists looked at the case-fatality rate (CFR) in the youngest children, they found that it was 77%, notably higher than the CFR of 57% for Ebola patients older than 5.

The aency said the pattern is similar to what was seen in West Africa's outbreak and that a number of factors might explain the higher CRF in young kids. Possible explanations could include lower proportions of young children treated at ETCs, higher baseline mortality, and missed vaccination owing to kids not being listed as contacts.

Not surprisingly, CFRs were much lower in younger and older kids (50% and 39%, respectively) who were treated in ETCs when compared with those who weren't (86% and 68%, respectively).

The WHO said the finding reinforces the need to work with communities, especially parents of young children, to seek care at ETCs as early as possible to give kids the best chance at survival. Kids of all ages, including babies, with suspected or confirmed Ebola can get specific, supportive care at ETCs, where pediatric-specific equipment is available, along with trained specialists and access to experimental therapies.

DRC reports reflect ongoing activity in several hot spots

In daily updates yesterday and today, the DRC's health ministry reported 29 more cases, raising the total to 1,974 infections, which includes 1,880 confirmed and 94 probable cases. Health officials are still investigating 328 suspected cases.

The latest cases continue to be reported from the main hot spots, both big and small. They include Mabalako (9), Katwa (7), Beni (4), Butembo (3), Musienene (2), Kalunguta (2), Mandima (1), and Vuhovi (1).

Twenty-one more people died from Ebola, including 12 in the community, an occurrence that raises the risk of further transmission. The fatality count now stands at 1,323.

One of the new community deaths was in a vaccinated health worker from Mabalako who self-medicated and refused transfer to an ETC. The patient's infection raises the number of health workers infected in the outbreak to 109 and the number who died from the disease to 37.

Over the weekend, the ministry of health in the DRC recorded 20 new cases of the virus, and reports on Twitter suggest the ministry will announce 14 more cases today. If confirmed, the cases will raise the outbreak total to 2,008 cases.

The cases over the weekend originated in Mabalako, Katwa, Beni, Butembo, and Mangurujipa, all villages and cities in North Kivu province. Sixteen deaths were also recorded over the weekend, bringing the fatality total to 1,339 as of yesterday.

This outbreak, in its 11th month, is the world's second largest after West Africa's 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, which involved more than 28,600 cases and more than 11,300 deaths.

The DRC topped 1,000 cases on Mar 24—8 months into the outbreak. It added its second 1,000 cases in only 71 days, or just a little over 2 months later, data that demonstrate how the outbreak has accelerated.

Vaccine for pregnant, lactating women

Yesterday the ministry of health confirmed that an ethics committee at the School of Public Health at the University of Kinshasa had approved an amendment to the vaccination protocol dictating the use of Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine.

The amendment will allow clinicians to offer the vaccine to pregnant women past their first trimester of pregnancy and to lactating women, if they are identified as case contacts. The committee maintains that only children over the age of 6 should be vaccinated.

The DRC health ministry first approved use of the vaccine in pregnant and lactating women on Feb 20. Yesterday's step clarifies the target population.

According to the ministry of health, from Nov 26, 2018, to May 26, 2019, 319 pregnant women and 603 lactating women have registered as contacts and could not be vaccinated.

As of yesterday, 129,001 people had been vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed vaccine. Among the recipients are 35,605 high-risk contacts, 63,421 contacts of contacts, and 29,975 front-line providers.

In its daily update yesterday, the DRC said the outbreak passed the 2,000-case bar on Jun 2. Officials said that, although the landmark is concerning, the health ministry sees some positive signs, including a slight improvement in the security situation, though the situation remains volatile and unpredictable.

The ministry added that most incidents related to community resistance have been resolved by community leaders, sensitizers, and psychosocial experts.

Another positive sign is that the outbreak is still geographically contained, though the risk remains high because of significant population movements. Also, nine earlier-affected health zones have gone 21 days without reporting any new cases.

DRC officials said the three main challenges are stronger identification and follow-up of all contacts of confirmed cases and infection prevention and control in community health facilities, where 25% to 30% of Ebola infections occur. Also, the ministry said community death rates remain high, and 28% to 43% of Ebola deaths are occurring outside Ebola treatment or transit centers.

'Drastic change is required'

In a statement yesterday, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) pointed out that, since the outbreak total hit 1,000 in late March, daily cases have more than tripled. The group is working in Katwa, Butembo, and Beni to support health ministry staff, is helping the provincial capital city Goma prepare for Ebola, and is working with women and children to help them cope with the outbreak's impact.

With persistent mistrust and insecurity hampering daily response activities, the current total is probably an undercount, the IRC warned.

Tariq Riebl, IRC emergency response director, said, ""The fact that we have hit 2,000 persons infected with Ebola so quickly demonstrates that this outbreak is spreading faster when it should be slowing. We are now seeing eight to 20 cases recorded each day,"" adding that just a few months ago, officials were recording 3 to 5 new cases each day.

""To see such a spike in cases at this stage in the outbreak means a drastic change is required. This response requires a total and complete reset,"" he said. He noted that a recently announced scale-up by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, a group that coordinates humanitarian assistance between groups under the United Nations (UN) umbrella and nongovernmental organizations, is a step in the right direction.

In a statement today, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) also called for a response restart. Nicole Fassina, the IFRC's Ebola coordinator, said the response has undoubtedly saved lives and prevented the spread of the disease, but now a reset is needed to put communities at the center of all efforts.

The IFRC also raised concerns about the use of more intensive security or military support, despite ongoing community resistance and threats and attacks from armed groups. ""Increasing armed protection for Ebola responders may aggravate the tensions that already exist between communities and responders,"" it said.

And Oxfam today, as it weighed in on the 2,000-case landmark, said it welcomed the UN-led scale-up in humanitarian aid, which it said is a crucial part of building trust with communities, after months of mistrust. Oxfam has been working in the outbreak region to support the public health response at the community level, to provide safe and clean water, and to improve health center infrastructure.

Corrine N'Daw, Oxfam's country director, said in a statement, ""Our teams are still meeting people on a daily basis who don't believe Ebola is real. While we are working to challenge that, many cases are going un-noticed because people with symptoms have been avoiding treatment. This lack of trust makes it impossible to break the chain of transmission.""

Deaths rise to 1,346

Meanwhile, in its daily update yesterday, the DRC reported 14 new cases, lifting the official total to 2,008. The latest infections are in five different hot spots: Mabalako, Butembo, Katwa, Mandima, and Kalunguta. Health officials are still following up on 281 suspected cases.

Seven more people died from Ebola, boosting the fatality count to 1,346. Six people died in community settings, an occurrence that raises the risk of transmission, and one person died at Butembo's Ebola treatment center.

The number of confirmed cases reached the milestone three times as quickly as it took to reach 1,000, experts said on Tuesday.

Eastern DRC is now in the midst of the second-worst outbreak of the disease in history. Attacks by rebel groups have complicated health workers' efforts to contain it.

In Beni, 16 people were killed in clashes with suspected Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels, 13 of them civilians, an official said on Tuesday.

Militia attacks have hindered treatment and complicated the United Nations's response to the crisis. Local mistrust of health workers has also contributed to an acceleration of the spread of Ebola.

The outbreak reached 1,000 cases in March, more than seven months after it was first detected in August last year.

It took less than three more months to reach 2,000, according to the DRC's health ministry. More than 1,300 people have died.

Responders face twin obstacles: resistance from communities who believe that Ebola is a conspiracy made up by aid agencies and the government, and from armed groups seeking to stoke instability for their own gain.

""The current response to tackle Ebola isn't working,"" Corinne N'Daw, Oxfam's country director in Congo told Reuters.

""No matter how effective treatment is, if people don't trust or understand it, they will not use it.""

The 2,000 figure is a ""sad and frustrating milestone ... the insecurity is holding us back,"" said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic.

A mob killed an Ebola health worker and looted a clinic in the village of Vusahiro earlier this month.

Between January and early May, there were 42 attacks on health facilities, with 85 workers either injured or killed, according to WHO figures from May 3.

""Every time there is an incident ... we are not able to provide services and go into communities. We are not able to vaccinate, not able to treat those who are ill, we are not able to follow up on those who may have been exposed to the virus,"" Jasarevic said.

Monday attack

The ADF fighting in Beni happened on Monday night, interim town Mayor Bakwanamaha Modeste told DPA news agency.

""We regret the death of 13 civilians and two military personnel,"" he said, adding that a rebel was also killed.

The incident comes a few days after the Congolese army said they had killed 26 ADF members in the same region.

The ADF is one of the numerous rebel groups that are active in eastern Congo, primarily fighting over the area's rich mineral resources.

The rebel group frequently launches attacks on civilians but recently has been responsible for attacks on United Nations peacekeepers as well.",no result found,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The number of Ebola cases in Democratic Republic of Congo has topped 2,000, according to new government figures that show the growth of the epidemic is gaining pace.

The world’s second-biggest outbreak has killed 1,346 people since it was detected in August last year.

It is the first time Ebola has struck in a conflict zone and the World Health Organization (WHO) has said the outbreak is unlikely to be contained unless violence stops.

Here are some key facts and figures about Ebola:

* The world’s worst epidemic of Ebola, a hemorrhagic fever, began in Guinea in December 2013 and swept through Liberia and Sierra Leone, killing more than 11,300 people by 2016.

* Ebola causes fever, flu-like pains, bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea and spreads among humans through contact with bodily fluids of an infected person.

* The world’s second-biggest outbreak of Ebola began in August 2018 in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, shortly after the country had quashed another outbreak.

* As of June 3, 2019, Congo’s health ministry reported 2,008 confirmed and probable cases with a death toll of 1,346.

* A mob killed an Ebola health worker and looted a clinic last week, one of many attacks by civilians and armed groups which have forced health workers to suspend activities and caused the number of cases to spike.

* Between January and early May, there were 42 attacks on health facilities, with 85 workers either injured or killed, according to WHO figures.

* Communities’ lack of trust in the responders remains a major obstacle, with many people avoiding treatment because they do not believe Ebola is real, according to Oxfam.

No one was injured in the robbery, but in Beni, 12 people were killed on the evening of Jun 3, the DRC said. ISIL, the Islamic State, is claiming responsibility for the attack, and an Al Jazeera report suggests this is the group's response to an altercation last week between the Congolese military and the terrorist organization Allied Democracy Forces (ADF) that left 26 ADF members dead.

ISIL also took credit for supporting those ADF fighters.

Response efforts continue

The DRC said response efforts are still under way in Beni, despite the chaos.

""This Tuesday morning, hundreds of protesters took to the streets and several commercial activities were paralyzed in the city. The Beni response teams worked slowly and cautiously, but no response activity was temporarily suspended,"" the health ministry wrote.

Yesterday and today the ministry of health confirmed 17 new Ebola case and 11 deaths, raising outbreak totals to 2,025 cases and 1,357 deaths. A total of 295 suspected cases are still under investigation. The new cases come from current hotspots, including Mandima, Katwa, Mabalako, Butembo, Beni, and Kalunguta.

Another health worker has been infected with Ebola, this time a vaccinated worker in Beni. This raises to 110 the number of health workers infected during this outbreak. Thirty-seven health workers have died.

WHO notes violence but less intensity

In the latest outbreak situation report from the World Health Organization (WHO), the organization said there were some signs that transmission intensity was on the decline in North Kivu province.

A total of 88 confirmed cases were reported each week for the past 2 weeks, the WHO said, which is down from the peak of 126 cases per week observed in April.

""Concurrently, improvements in the proportion of cases among contacts registered prior to onset (up from 30% three weeks ago to 55% last week), and a lower proportion of cases resulting from transmission within community health facilities (from 31% during the first week of April 2019 to 9% during the last week of May 2019), are encouraging, although both indicators are below where we would aim to be,"" the WHO said.

Declines in transmission were most markedly seen in Katwa, Mandima, and Beni. In the last 3 weeks, more cases have been reported in Mabalako and Butembo.

The case-fatality ratio for the outbreak remains at 67%, and 29% of cases are in children under 18.

Vaccination efforts with Merck's VSV-EBOV continue with 130,254 people vaccinated as of today. According to the WHO, only 9.2% of current cases do not have a ring vaccination program in place.

More than 500 people have recovered from Ebola during this outbreak, and the WHO recently confirmed that trained psychological staff are being put in Ebola treatment centers throughout the region to help victims and survivors. Staff also focus on reintegrating survivors into communities and fighting lasting stigma.

Jun 5 WHO psychological story","ISIL has claimed responsibility for a deadly attack in an Ebola-stricken eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

In a statement issued on Tuesday by the armed group via Telegram, an encrypted messaging application, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) group said it had targeted military forces in the city of Beni a day earlier, killing or wounding 25 people.

The group's account of the violence appeared to differ from local reports. Modeste Bakwanamaha, deputy mayor of Beni, told Reuters news agency that 13 civilians were killed in an attack late on Monday.

Bakwanamaha said fighters from the rebel Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) - a group thought to be linked to ISIL - were responsible for the assault.

""The victims were killed by bullets and others by bladed weapons,"" Bakwanamaha said.

He added that the violence was likely a response to a crackdown by the DRC's army last week that killed 26 ADF members after they had earlier attacked an army position in Ngite, a village near Beni.

The ADF has never claimed allegiance to ISIL, but the latter recently alleged that its ""Central Africa Province"" affiliate had inflicted ""dozens of casualties"" on Congolese forces, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors the armed group's online activity. There was no independent confirmation of the claims.

Ebola surges amid insecurity

The ADF, originally a Ugandan group, has been operating along the DRC's border with Uganda for more than two decades. It is one of scores of rival armed factions active in the region, including in the area around Beni, which is at the epicentre of an ongoing Ebola outbreak.

The widespread insecurity has hampered efforts to battle the epidemic, now the second-worst on record, with more than 100 attacks on treatment centres and health workers recorded since the beginning of the year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

190522231352900

Amid the unrest, the number of recorded cases surged past 2,000 this week as the rate of infection continued to accelerate.

The outbreak, which emerged in the DRC's eastern North Kivu province in August and later spread to the neighbouring Ituri province, has killed 1,354 people so far, according to the latest figures from the DRC's health ministry.

Health workers have inoculated more than 100,000 people to date as part of a government-backed vaccination programme aimed at containing the spread of the virus.

The vaccine is experimental but is estimated to be 97.5 percent effective.

Experts and aid agencies have warned the situation for responders on the ground has become ""poisoned"", however, with health workers faced with widespread community distrust over the epidemic.

According to a recent study by the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, large segments of the local population believe the virus is a fabrication invented for the financial gain of business-owning local elites or to further destabilise the area.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, last month described the situation as ""one of the most complex health emergencies any of us have ever faced"".

""Unless we unite to end this outbreak, we run the very real risk that it will become more widespread, more expensive and more aggressive,"" Ghebreyesus said.",no result found,no result found,no result found
6-Jun-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

As the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak surpasses the 2000 case mark, indicators over the past two weeks provide early signs of an easing of the transmission intensity. This follows a period of improved security and therefore access to communities, allowing response teams to operate more freely. A total of 88 confirmed cases were reported each week for the past two epidemiological weeks, down from a peak of 126 cases per week observed in April. Declines in the incidence of new cases have been most apparent in hotspots such as Katwa, Mandima and Beni health zones. Concurrently, improvements in the proportion of cases among contacts registered prior to onset (up from 30% three weeks ago to 55% last week), and a lower proportion of cases resulting from transmission within community health facilities (from 31% during the first week of April 2019 to 9% during the last week of May 2019), are encouraging. Nevertheless, both indicators are below where we would aim to be. The outbreak continues to be contained within 12 active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

However, substantive rates of transmission continue within affected communities, and further waves of the outbreak may be expected. An increase in the incidence of new cases has been reported from Mabalako Health Zone in recent weeks, and high infection rates continue within Butembo metropolitan. Times between detecting, reporting and admission of cases at Ebola treatment/transit centres (ETCs) remains too long (median 6 days, interquartile range 4–9 days in the past 3 weeks), with about a third (34% in the past 3 weeks) of cases dying outside of ETCs. Collectively these indicators highlight that the risks associated with this outbreak remain very high.

In the 21 days between 15 May to 4 June 2019, 80 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases, representing 12% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 280 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the Mabalako (27%, n=75), Butembo (23%, n=63), Katwa (16%, n=44), Beni (11%, n=30), Kalunguta (8%, n=23), Mandima (7%, n=19) and Musienene (5%, n=14) health zones.

As of 4 June 2019, a total of 2025 EVD cases, including 1931 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1357 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1263 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2025 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 58% (1170) were female, and 29% (589) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 110 (5% of total cases).

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases were observed from February through mid-May 2019, with lower though still substantial rates since then. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, especially over the past four weeks, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. In order to ensure staff safety and security, security mitigation measures are being enhanced, and procedural, operational, and physical security challenges are being addressed. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigate local spread. These efforts must continue to be scaled-up.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

""At any point it could flare up within a zone,"" said Mike Ryan, MD, a WHO assistant director-general. Ryan, citing information contained in yesterday's WHO Ebola situation report, said there are some encouraging signs, including lower transmission rates in known hot spots and more surveillance.

""Surveillance has intensified to 1,300 alerts per day, of which between 200 and 300 are validated and tested,” Ryan said. ""The number of contacts being followed is 15,000.""

Ryan said the outbreak's reproduction rate is 1.04, meaning that every Ebola case begets one additional case. That means transmission is flat, not increasing, but also not decreasing significantly.

As many as 25% of cases missed

Throughout the press conference, Ryan called the outbreak complex. In addition to the security challenges in the region, he said certain health-seeking behavior and community death practices have contributed to the outbreak's longevity.

About 20% of Ebola case-patients first seek healthcare in a health zone far away from where they live, which makes it hard to make connections between transmission chains. Additionally, several deaths are still occurring in the community. Each community death, Ryan said, raises the risk of further disease spread.

Ryan also said the WHO estimates it is detecting 75% of cases, with as many as 25% missed or being picked up ""too late.""

He also responded to recent criticism from various non-governmental organizations that the WHO needs to ""reset"" the outbreak response.

""This is not an iPhone. We don't just hit a reset button,"" Ryan said. ""We get to adapt… and make the response the best we can make it.""

He also reminded the reporters in the room that 80% of vaccinators in the region are Congolese, and most doctors and nurses working the outbreak are Congolese.

""It's Congolese people ending this outbreak,"" he said.

Today the DRC ministry of health confirmed 6 new cases of Ebola and 10 deaths, raising outbreak totals to 2,031 cases and 1,367 deaths. Three of the 10 deaths occurred in the community, which is a lower percentage than usual.

A total of 293 suspected cases are still under investigation, and 130,711 have been vaccinated. The number of infected healthcare workers remained at 110.

Vaccine predicted to run out

Yesterday Robert Redfield, MD, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told Congress that the world must be prepared for this outbreak to spread internationally, and for vaccine supplies to dwindle, according to a Devex story.

Ryan, when asked about Redfield's comments, deflected. ""Dr. Redfield is trying to bring attention to the outbreak; that's a good thing,"" he said.

Redfield said vaccine production is being held up by plant validation. Merck had manufactured the vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV in Pennsylvania until recently moving the operation to Germany.

There are currently about 145,000 doses of the vaccine, too few for a planned broader vaccination campaign that would look toward vaccinating geographic regions instead of contact rings.

Jun 6 DRC report

Jun 6 Devex article",no result found,no result found,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Roughly a quarter of Ebola infections in eastern Congo are estimated to be going undetected or found too late, a World Health Organization (WHO) expert said on Thursday.

But the WHO, in a weekly update issued subsequently, said there were “early signs” of an easing of the intensity with which the virus is spreading following weeks of insecurity that curbed access to communities and interrupted vaccination.

Some 2,025 cases and 1,357 deaths have been recorded since the epidemic began in August in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s North Kivu and Ituri provinces, said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme.

It is the second-worst outbreak of the virus on record.

Some 88 infections have been detected each of the last two weeks, down from a peak of 126 weekly in April, and WHO teams are checking 15,000 suspected contacts each day for symptoms, he added.

“We believe, let me be very cautious here, we believe we are probably detecting in excess of 75% of cases - we may be missing up to a quarter of cases,” Ryan told a news briefing in Geneva.

“We must get earlier detection of cases, have more exhaustive identification of contacts,” he said.

About 90% of people potentially exposed to the virus have agreed to be vaccinated, which has proved efficient, he said. “It’s not them that matter now, it’s the 10% that don’t, because all of our cases are coming from that group.”

More than 130,000 people have been vaccinated to date, Congolese figures show.

The epidemic is “not out of control, but it is certainly not under control,” he said.

It was spreading fast in the rural area of Mabalako and at a lesser rate in the city of Butembo.

A third of identified cases are people who died without having being admitted to Ebola treatment centers, the WHO update said.

Ryan said risks to aid workers had decreased of late but noted a deadly attack on civilians earlier this week.

A local official said 13 civilians were killed late on Monday in an attack by the Allied Democratic Forces - a group thought to be linked to Islamic State.

Greater political engagement is needed to combat the Ebola outbreak, Ryan said. “We need the government to reach out to the opposition, we need an ‘all party’ approach ... we need a single voice of leaders in Congo about this outbreak.”",no result found

As the outbreak crossed the 2,000-case milestone earlier this week, the WHO has taken stock of the outbreak response and seen some signs of progress toward ending it.

""A total of 88 confirmed cases were reported each week for the past two epidemiological weeks, down from a peak of 126 cases per week observed in April. Declines in the incidence of new cases have been most apparent in hotspots such as Katwa, Mandima and Beni health zones,"" the WHO said.

In April, 31% of cases were transmitted nosocomially—in healthcare settings—by the last week of May, that percentage fell to 9%.

Also encouraging are improvements in the proportion of cases among contacts registered prior to onset. The WHO said that 3 weeks ago only 30% of such cases were registered, and last week that number rose to 55%. But that proportion, they cautioned, is still too high.

Eight new cases include health worker

In its daily Ebola outbreak update today, the DRC's ministry of health confirmed eight new cases and six new fatalities, raising the outbreak total to 2,039 cases and 1,373 deaths. A total of 283 suspected cases are still under investigation.

The cases occurred in Mabalako, Mandima, Beni, Butembo, and Katwa—all known hot spots. Of the six deaths, five took place in the community, which raises the risk of further transmission.

The WHO said 34% of fatalities in the past 3 weeks have died outside of Ebola treatment centers. The agency also noted that the time between detecting, reporting, and admitting cases to Ebola treatment centers remains too long (median 6 days, interquartile range, 4 to 9 days in the past 3 weeks.)

The ministry also said one new vaccinated health worker from Mabalako was diagnosed as having Ebola. The case raises the total number of healthcare workers infected in this outbreak to 111, including 37 deaths.

As of today, 131,004 have been vaccinated with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV as part of a ring vaccination campaign.

Jun 6 WHO Ebola report

Jun 7 DRC update","One-quarter of Ebola infections in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo's latest outbreak of the disease may be going undetected, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.

Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said on Thursday the epidemic was ""not out of control, but it is certainly not under control"", with insecurity and community mistrust hampering emergency responders' efforts.

""We believe we are probably detecting in excess of 75 percent of cases. We may be missing up to a quarter of cases,"" Ryan said at a press conference in the Swiss city of Geneva.

""We must get earlier detection of cases, [and] have more exhaustive identification of contacts,"" he added.

More than 2,000 cases - involving 1,357 deaths - have been recorded since the epidemic started in the DRC's North Kivu and Ituri provinces in August.

The outbreak - the second-worst on record - reached 1,000 cases in March. It then took less than three more months to surpass 2,000, signalling a tripling in the rate of infection.

In a bid to contain its spread, health workers inoculated more than 130,000 people to date as part of a government-backed vaccination programme. The vaccine is experimental but is estimated to be 97.5 percent effective and, according to the WHO, may protect a person for up to 12 months.

Transmission slows

In a weekly update issued separately on Thursday, the WHO said there were ""early signs"" of an easing of the intensity with which the virus was spreading following weeks of insecurity that curbed access to communities and interrupted the vaccination programme.

190520192739220

There was a total of 88 confirmed cases in each of the last two weeks, down from a peak of 126 over a seven-day stretch at the end of April, according to WHO's update. A third of the identified cases were people who died without having being admitted to Ebola treatment centres.

Ryan said about 90 percent of people potentially exposed to the virus had agreed to be vaccinated, with WHO teams checking some 15,000 suspected contacts each day for symptoms.

""[But] it's not them that matter now, it's the 10 percent that don't, because all of our cases are coming from that group,"" he added.

Health teams have been unable to reach some areas because of violence by rebel groups, with scores of rival armed factions active in the region. More than 100 attacks on treatment centres and health workers have been recorded since the beginning of the year, according to WHO.

'We need a single voice'

Experts and aid agencies warned the situation for responders on the ground has become ""poisoned"" amid the violence and widespread community distrust over the epidemic.

According to a recent study by the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, large segments of the local population believe the virus is a fabrication invented for the financial gain of business-owning local elites or to further destabilise the area.

Fewer than two-thirds of the nearly 1,000 respondents said they would take a vaccine for Ebola.

190605052723255

Ryan said risks to health workers had decreased of late, but he called on the DRC's political leaders to act in unison and build trust with impacted communities to end the epidemic.

""We need the government to reach out to the opposition, we need an 'all-party' approach... We need a single voice of leaders in [DR] Congo about this outbreak,"" he said.

The cautious notes of optimism were in contrast to messages from earlier in the week from other partners in the response, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC’s director, Dr. Robert Redfield, warned Tuesday that the world needs to prepare for the possibility the epidemic could drag on for another year or two. And Tariq Riebl, an emergency response director for the International Rescue Committee, said the sharp rise in case in cases this spring, at a time when an outbreak ought to be coming under control, suggested drastic changes are needed. “This response requires a total and complete reset,” Riebl said.

The WHO’s Dr. Mike Ryan, who is executive director of the global health agency’s emergencies program, said Redfield’s estimation was a worst-case scenario. But he said other possibilities include halting spread in the Congolese provinces of North Kivu and Ituri much sooner than that.

“The outcome is effort related,” Ryan said. “Are we prepared to make immediate, sustained, comprehensive effort to bring this disease under control? And if we are, I believe the timelines can be much shorter than the ones stated.”

“But … I think Dr. Redfield is really trying to wake the world up to the fact that this is a very complex situation and that if we keep operating at less than perfect efficiency, we may end up being around dealing with this outbreak for a very long time.”

Ryan pushed back against the call for a total reset, saying that’s not an option available to the response.

“Adapt, yes. Learn, yes. Change things, yes,” Ryan said. “I’ve been through a lot of Ebola and other outbreaks. There are no magic bullets. There are no unicorns. It’s just hard work and learning from what we do.”

The outbreak, which passed the 2,000-case mark at the beginning of the week, is the second largest on record. As of Tuesday, there have been 2,025 cases and 1,357 deaths.

While the outbreak is still substantially smaller than the 2014-2016 West African outbreak — which spanned multiple countries, accruing more than 28,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths — the WHO has said it might be the toughest the agency and its partners have had to fight.

The affected provinces have been embroiled in a more than two-decades-long conflict, making travel to and work in some communities difficult and dangerous. The years of fighting have left the people in the region highly distrustful of their own government and anyone deemed to be an outsider.

That has made the critical work of Ebola containment — finding cases, figuring out who has been exposed to the cases, persuading contacts to be vaccinated, and persuading people sick with the virus to be treated in specially equipped health centers — challenging to achieve. Since late February, the Ebola response teams and facilities have been the targets of multiple attacks, several of which have claimed lives of response workers.

While the response teams often need armed guards to travel about, people in the region move freely and often. Ryan noted that about one-fifth of the people who have been infected have traveled to another health zone from the one in which they live when they first seek care — often starting spread in new locations as a consequence, or reigniting transmission in a location where it had previously been stopped.

That tendency also complicates the job of figuring out who infected whom. Response workers need to figure out where the virus is circulating and who has been in its path, so that people who are at risk of contracting Ebola can be offered an experimental vaccine being used to help stop the outbreak.

Ryan acknowledged officials believe they are detecting only about 75% of cases. Improving that figure will involve persuading the affected communities to cooperate with containment efforts, he said.

Still, Ryan said there are signs of progress. There have been 88 cases a week in the past couple of weeks, down from an average of 126 cases a week in April. And the number of case contacts being monitored daily to see if they have developed symptoms dropped from a high of 20,000 a day to 15,000, he said."

In a related development, a snapshot from the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office notes a continued decline in weekly cases, which it says is encouraging.

New cases in 8 locations

The 23 new cases are in Mabalako (8), Mandima (4), Butembo (3), Beni (2), Katwa (2), Musienene (2), Mangurujipa (1), and Rwampara (1).

The infections lift the overall outbreak total to 2,062 cases, which includes 1,968 confirmed and 94 probable cases.

Seventeen more people died from Ebola, boosting the outbreak's fatality count to 1,390. Six of the deaths occurred in community settings, a factor that greatly increases the risk of virus transmission, and 11 occurred at Ebola treatment centers.

In its Jun 8 report, the health ministry said the case in Rwampara, a health zone in Ituri province, involves a community death of a mother whose child died from Ebola in Oicha in early May. The woman had not been vaccinated and wasn't followed. When her symptoms began, a traditional healer treated her for poisoning.

The patient was admitted to a health post a few days later, and while being transferred to another health center at the request of her family the woman died. Outbreak responders were able to conduct a safe and dignified burial, DRC officials said.

The cases involving healthcare workers are in Mabalako. One worker is a vaccinated nurse who agreed to be taken to an Ebola treatment center after she tested positive for Ebola, marking the second case at the same clinic following the admission of several Ebola patients. The other is also a vaccinated health worker, raising the cumulative number of cases in healthcare workers to 113.

Declining trend continues

In its regular weekly update on emergencies and outbreaks, the WHO African regional office said today that the week ending Jun 8 marked another decline in cases, part of a pattern in recent weeks. It said 62 cases were confirmed over the past week, compared with 82 the previous week.

WHO officials attributed some of the drop in cases to improved security and better access to communities, though vandalism in Komanda shuttered the Ebola testing lab and demonstrations by motorcycle taxi drivers left the lab in Beni partly functional.

Mabalako, Butembo, and Katwa are still the main hot spots, though several other areas remain points of concern, the report said.

The decline is encouraging and highlights the commitment of local and national health officials, as well as their partners, the WHO said, noting that community mobilization activities combined with proven public health measures need to continue to keep the momentum going and bring the outbreak to a close.

The patient and his family arrived in Uganda on Jun 10 through the Bwera Border post and sought medical care at Kagando hospital where health workers identified Ebola as a possible cause of illness, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement today.

The child is currently receiving supportive care at the Bwera Ebola Treatment Unit, and all contacts are being followed.

Two contacts have symptoms

On Twitter, Jane Ruth Aceng, MD, the minister of health for Uganda, posted a statement on the case, describing the boy's mother as being Congolese, and having recently taken care of the boy's grandfather in the DRC. The grandfather died from Ebola in Mabalako, one of the DRC's current hot spots, the statemenet said.

Aceng described a robust monitoring system that worked as planned on the border between DRC and Uganda, and said her country had gone from preparedness to ""response mode,"" with this case.

All of the boy's family members are in isolation, Aceng said, with two case-contacts showing symptoms of Ebola. Their infections have not yet been confirmed.

Some in family evaded checkpoint

According to an update posted by the DRC's minister of health today, the boy was traveling with 14 family members, 12 of whom were symptomatic, when they were detected by the teams of the National Border Health Program (PNHF) installed at Kasindi health checkpoint at the Ugandan border.

""Recognizing the symptoms of Ebola, PNHF teams did not let the family pass and transferred the 12 symptomatic people to the transitional isolation center at Kasindi Hospital pending transfer to the Ebola Treatment Center in Beni to take the samples. Of the 12 suspected cases, there were seven children aged 7 months to 12 years,"" the DRC said.

But six family members, including the 5-year-old boy, escaped through a secondary route on foot to avoid health checkpoints and entered Uganda, where they were intercepted.

Uganda’s readiness tested

For 10 months, Uganda has closely monitored its porous border with the DRC for crossover cases, yet, despite numerous alerts, no cases have been detected until now.

""In preparation for a possible imported case during the current outbreak in DRC, Uganda has vaccinated nearly 4,700 health workers in 165 health facilities (including in the facility where the child is being cared for); disease monitoring has been intensified; and health workers trained on recognizing symptoms of the disease. Ebola Treatment Units are in place,"" the WHO regional office for Africa said in a news release.

The International Rescue Committee (IRC) also posted a statement on the case.

""The IRC is extremely alarmed by this development, but our teams in Uganda have been training and preparing for this possibility, working in infection prevention and control and training health clinics in the country to recognize symptoms and safely triage and transfer suspected cases to Ebola treatment centers,"" the IRC said.

For now, Aceng said Ugandan front line workers will continue to receive the VSV-EBOV vaccine to protect themselves from the virus.

WHO emergency panel on standby

On Twitter, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus, PhD, said the WHO was ""contacting members of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee & asking them to be on standby.""

The WHO's emergency committee has met twice to weigh whether the DRC's Ebola developments should constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). At the group's last meeting in April, lack of international spread was among the reasons the group held off on recommending a PHEIC declaration.

The health agency said in a statement on Tuesday that the boy had travelled with family from the DRC to Uganda on June 9.

""The child and his family entered the country through Bwera Border post and sought medical care at Kagando hospital [in Kasese, Uganda] where health workers identified Ebola as a possible cause of illness,"" it added.

Uganda's health ministry said the boy and his relatives, including his mother - a Congolese woman married to a Ugandan man residing in Kasese - had travelled to DRC before returning to Uganda on June 10.

Uganda's health ministry and the WHO sent a team to the western town of Kasese to trace likely cases and vaccinate those who might have come into contact with the patient, the statement continued.

Uganda has been on high alert since the start of the Ebola outbreak in DRC in August 2018. More than 2,000 cases of the highly contagious virus have been recorded, including 1,357 deaths, in eastern DRC's North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

190522231352900

The disease is spread mainly through contact with the bodily fluids of those infected.

According to the WHO, Uganda vaccinated nearly 4,700 health workers in 165 facilities with an experimental drug designed to protect them against the virus.

Uganda has experienced several outbreaks in the past, most recently in 2012, while in 2000 more than 200 people died in an outbreak in the north of the country.

DRC measles epidemic

While health officials have focused on the far deadlier hemorrhagic Ebola virus concentrated in DRC's east, some 87,000 suspected cases of measles have been reported across the vast central African country in the first four and a half months of this year.

The health ministry revealed the measles figure when it declared the epidemic on Monday.

In a statement on Tuesday, medical charity Doctors Without Borders called for ""a massive mobilisation of all relevant national and international organisations in order to vaccinate more children and treat patients"" affected by measles.

The health ministry said its vaccination campaign would target a further 1.4 million infants, and that 2.2 million had been vaccinated in April.",no result found,"GENEVA/KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda has confirmed its first case of Ebola during the current outbreak, a 5-year-old Congolese child who is receiving care after arriving from the Democratic Republic of Congo, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.

“This is the first confirmed case in Uganda during the Ebola outbreak on-going in neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo,” the WHO said in a statement.

The affected child had entered Uganda on June 9 through Bwera Border post. His family sought medical care at Kagando hospital and the child was transferred to Bwera Ebola Treatment Unit for management, the WHO said.

“The confirmation was made today by the Uganda Virus Institute (UVRI) ...contacts are being monitored,” WHO said.

The boy was accompanied by his Ugandan father and Congolese mother, who had had returned to Congo to nurse her father before he died of Ebola, Uganda’s Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng told a news conference. The family returned to Uganda with four other family members of Congolese origin, Aceng said.

All the other Congolese family members are in isolation at Bwera Hospital. Two of them have already developed symptoms similar to those of Ebola and samples have been removed from them, Aceng said. Results of tests are expected Wednesday. Eight more contacts are being followed up, Aceng said.

Aceng said the family entered Uganda on June 10, not 9. The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear and neither the WHO nor the government was reachable for clarification.

Since the epidemic began in August in eastern Congo, the Congo health ministry said on Monday that it had recorded 2,062 cases, including 1,390 deaths.

Neighboring Uganda has suffered regular outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg over the years, both high-fatality viral hemorrhagic fevers. Health facilities to treat the diseases are relatively robust.

A donor-supported laboratory in Entebbe, a lakeside town south of the capital Kampala, means Uganda typically confirms outbreaks much faster than many of its neighbors.

Preparing for possible cases of Ebola, Uganda has vaccinated nearly 4,700 health workers, disease monitoring has been intensified, special treatment units set up and health workers have been trained to recognize symptoms of the disease, WHO said.

Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today announced it has activated its emergency operations center (EOC) to support efforts to battle the DRC's Ebola outbreak, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) yesterday reported nine more cases.

Two of boy's family members infected

The two newly confirmed cases in Uganda are both part of the family from the DRC that was stopped at a health checkpoint at the Ugandan border, some of whom escaped to Uganda. Health officials reported yesterday that they detected the virus in one of the them, a 5-year-old boy.

In its statement today, Uganda's health ministry said the boy died this morning.

One of the new cases is the boy's 50-year-old grandmother, and the other is his 3-year-old brother. They had several Ebola symptoms, including vomiting blood and bloody diarrhea, and they are being treated in isolation at Bwera Hospital Ebola treatment unit (ETU), located in Kasese district near the DRC-Uganda border.

In a weekly situation report today, the World Health Organization (WHO) said another suspected case has been admitted to the Bwera ETU, and test results are pending.

Eight contacts have been identified and are under monitoring, the Ugandan health ministry said. It also added that top health officials are in Kasese district and rapid response teams are on the ground to assess the situation and help district officials with response steps such as contact tracing, case management, surveillance, and risk communication.

Uganda's health ministry and the WHO will conduct ring vaccination of patient contacts and unvaccinated health workers beginning on Jun 14.

Emergency panel to meet for third time

The WHO today said Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, has reconvened the Ebola emergency committee for Jun 14 to discuss the latest developments, assess if changes warrant declaring a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under International Health Regulations, and to update any earlier recommendations.

The upcoming event marks the emergency committee's third meeting to discuss the DRC's latest Ebola outbreak. At its last meeting on Apr 12, the group said lack of international spread was one of the reasons it held off on recommending a PHEIC declaration. WHO emergency committees typically meet every 3 months, or more often, based on outbreak developments.

In a statement sent to journalists, the WHO said it would hold a media telebriefing after the emergency committee meets to announce the group's recommendations.

CDC steps up support

In a news release today, the CDC said its EOC activation is at level 3, the lowest level, but it paves the way to increase support for the CDC's expanded response team deployed in the DRC.

CDC Director Robert Redfield, MD, said in the release, ""Through CDC's command center we are consolidating our public health expertise and logistics planning for a longer term, sustained effort to bring this complex epidemic to an end.""

Yesterday in a press release on Uganda's first imported case linked to the DRC outbreak, Redfield said, ""This is a sobering development that everyone has been working to avoid, and highlights the complexity of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.""

Since August when the DRC's latest outbreak began, the CDC has been helping the DRC government with the outbreak response and has deployed experts on epidemiology, case management, infection control and prevention, laboratory science, border health, risk communication, community engagement, information technology, emergency management, and logistics. And since September the CDC has been helping the US Agency for International Development (USAID) Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) and the American Embassy in Kinshasa.

As of Jun 11, 187 CDC staff have completed 187 deployments, not only to the DRC but also to Uganda, other neighboring countries, and WHO headquarters in Geneva.

DRC cases reach 2,071

In its daily update yesterday, the DRC health ministry announced nine new cases in six locations, all of them among the current hot spots.

One of the latest cases involves a member of a burial team in Musienene who had not been vaccinated. He had cared for his brother who died from Ebola. When he was recruited for the burial team, he told his superiors that he had already been vaccinated.

The latest illnesses boost the overall outbreak total to 2,071 cases, which include 1,977 confirmed and 94 probable cases. Health officials are still investigating 284 suspected cases. The WHO's online Ebola dashboard suggests the DRC's health ministry will likely announce 13 new cases today.

Six more people died from Ebola, two in community settings and four in Ebola treatment centers. The new developments put the fatality count at 1,396.

WHO: 115 health workers infected

In its weekly situation report, the WHO said the boy identified as Uganda's first patient and his mother are from Uganda and had been in the DRC's Mabalako health zone, where they attended the burial of the boy's grandfather, who had died from Ebola in the community on Jun 1.

The WHO said it and Uganda's health ministry have deployed a multisector rapid response team to the affected district.

Meanwhile, in the DRC, the number of new cases shows a decline, with 54 reported over the past week, compared with 88 the week before. Though some areas are seeing fewer cases—such as Katwa, Beni, and Kalunguta—the situation is more tenuous elsewhere. ""Active transmission is ongoing in communities within 11 health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces,"" the WHO said.

Cases continue to rise among health workers, with 115 reported so far, which makes up 6% of the outbreak total. The DRC yesterday reported 113 cases among healthcare workers.

The WHO said the decline in cases in the two affected DRC provinces is encouraging, affirming the commitment of local, national, and international partners. It added, however, that Ebola's appearance in Uganda is of grave concern, highlighting the region's vulnerability to the spread of the disease.

Jane Ruth Aceng, Uganda's health minister, said seven others suspected to have been infected with the virus were being monitored.

An expert committee will meet on Friday in Geneva to discuss whether to declare the Ebola outbreak a global health emergency, the WHO said in a statement on Wednesday.

Two previous such meetings decided the outbreak was not yet fit for a declaration of that nature, despite being of ""deep concern"".

Regional concern

Uganda and the wider East Africa region have been on high alert over Ebola since the virus emerged in the DRC's North Kivu and Ituri provinces in August last year. More than 2,000 cases have been recorded since the start of the outbreak, the DRC's 10th to date, and nearly 1,400 people have died.

In a precautionary move, Uganda has vaccinated nearly 4,700 health workers in 165 facilities with an experimental drug designed to protect them against the virus.

Among those vaccinated are the members of a rapid response team who have been deployed to Kasese to trace likely cases and vaccinate those who might have come into contact with any people infected.

Experts have long feared Ebola could spread from the DRC to neighbouring countries, with regional insecurity and deep community mistrust hampering emergency responders' efforts to contain the virus.

More than 100 attacks on treatment centres and health workers in DRC have been recorded since the beginning of this year, according to WHO.

Last week, the United Nations agency warned that a quarter of all cases in the outbreak may be going undetected, with scores of victims dying without having been admitted to Ebola treatment centres.","Isaac Kasamani / AFP (file photo)|New confirmed Ebola cases in Uganda have raised fears of an outbreak spreading from DR Congo.

A five-year-old boy who tested positive for Ebola in Uganda has died, a health ministry official told AFP Wednesday as two of his family members also tested positive for the virus after a visit to neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.

The World Health Organisation confirmed on Twitter that Uganda has now recorded three cases of Ebola, in the first spread across the country's porous western border with the DRC where more than 2,000 cases of the highly contagious virus have been registered.

Uganda's health ministry said on Tuesday that a woman of Congolese origin, who is married to a Ugandan, had gone with her child and four other family members to take care of her father in the DRC, who later died of Ebola.

""The boy who tested positive for Ebola in Kasese yesterday passed on last night in the isolation unit,"" a health ministry official told AFP on condition of anonymity.

""The minister for health (Ruth Aceng) will be briefing the country about the death of the boy and arrangements to bury the body.""

The official said the child was likely to be buried Wednesday.

DRC Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga said the family were placed in isolation after being identified as in contact with an Ebola patient.

""During the isolation, some family members crossed into Uganda. As soon as they crossed, we contacted the Ugandan authorities,"" he told AFP in an interview Wednesday.

Uganda's health ministry said the family members had been identified and were placed in isolation in Bwera, a town near the border with DRC.

""Two more samples were sent to UVRI (Uganda Virus Research Institute) and have tested positive. We, therefore, have three confirmed cases of Ebola in Uganda,"" the WHO Uganda posted on its Twitter account, citing a briefing from Ugandan Health Minister Ruth Aceng in Kasese in the country's west.

Eight other people in contact with the family had been tracked down and were being monitored, the health ministry said.

High alert

East Africa has been on high alert since the outbreak in the eastern DRC.

According to the WHO, Uganda vaccinated nearly 4,700 health workers in 165 facilities with an experimental drug designed to protect them against the virus.

South Sudan has also declared a state of alert and vaccinated health workers.

Uganda has experienced several outbreaks in the past, most recently in 2012, while in 2000 more than 200 people died in an outbreak in the north of the country.

The Red Cross said it was scaling up efforts to contain the spread of the virus since it was detected in Uganda.

""This is a worrying development, but we have been preparing for this day for months now,"" Robert Kwesiga, Uganda Red Cross Secretary General, said in a statement Wednesday.

The DRC has struggled to contain the outbreak which was first recorded in North Kivu province and then spread to neighbouring Ituri and has left over 1,300 dead.

Efforts to tackle the crisis have been hampered both by militia attacks on treatment centres and by the hostility of some local people to the medical teams.

Five workers have been killed, according to an AFP tally, and important preventative work, such as vaccination programmes and burials of Ebola victims, has been delayed.

The outbreak is the 10th in Democratic Republic of Congo since the disease was identified in 1976.

It is the worst on record after an epidemic that struck Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone between 2014-2016, leaving more than 11,300 people dead.

Ebola is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads among humans through close contact with the blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected person.

(AFP)","KAMPALA/LONDON (Reuters) - Uganda announced two more cases of Ebola on Wednesday - a grandmother and a three-year-old boy, confirming that a deadly outbreak has spread for the first time beyond the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The Ugandan cases show the epidemic is entering a “truly frightening” phase and could kill many more people, one infectious disease specialist told Reuters.

A five-year-old boy who had crossed into Uganda from Congo died late on Tuesday, said Uganda’s health minister, Jane Ruth Aceng, and his family were now being monitored in isolation.

The two new victims were the boy’s brother and grandmother, the Ugandan Health Ministry said. His grandfather had recently died of Ebola.

Uganda plans to repatriate the two patients with Ebola to Congo, saying they can get better treatment in specialized facilities there. Three more family members, who are so far healthy, will also be repatriated, a health ministry spokesman said. The family must consent to all repatriations, he said.

“This epidemic is in a truly frightening phase and shows no sign of stopping,” said Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, which is involved in fighting Ebola.

“We can expect and should plan for more cases in DRC and neighboring countries,” he said, adding: “There are now more deaths than any other Ebola outbreak in history, bar the West Africa epidemic of 2013-16, and there can be no doubt that the situation could escalate towards those terrible levels.”

The current Ebola epidemic began in August last year in eastern Congo and has already infected at least 2,062 people, killing 1,390 of them.

The West Africa epidemic infected 28,000 people and killed 11,300, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

The viral disease spreads through contact with bodily fluids, causing hemorrhagic fever with severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding.

World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will reconvene an emergency committee on Friday to decide whether the outbreak is an international public health emergency and how to manage it, a WHO statement said.

VIOLENT BACKLASH

Authorities have struggled to contain the disease partly because health workers have been repeatedly attacked in conflict-ravaged eastern Congo, the epicenter of the outbreak.

This year, the WHO has documented 174 attacks on health care workers and facilities in Congo, causing 5 deaths and 51 injuries of health care workers and patients, Geneva-based spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told Reuters on Wednesday.

There is widespread public mistrust of the Congo government and health workers from outside the region, giving rise to rumors that the disease is a ruse to try to rig elections in the area, where dozens of armed groups operate.

Other rumors accuse health teams of spreading the disease. Many victims have sought treatment with traditional healers instead.

Uganda, which has been on high alert for a possible spread of Ebola and has already vaccinated many frontline health workers, is relatively well prepared to contain the virus. WHO is bringing in 3,500 additional vaccines and will begin vaccinating more people on Friday.

“The current cases in Uganda will be quickly contained but the failure to stop the current Ebola epidemic in DRC is simply tragic,” said Ian Jones, a professor virology at Britain’s Reading University.

Eastern Congo also borders South Sudan, which is struggling to emerge from five years of devastating civil war and whose health facilities are basic even in the capital.

“We are deeply concerned for countries such as South Sudan that do not have the infrastructure to handle an outbreak,” Whitney Elmer, Congo country director at aid group Mercy Corps.",no result found
13-Jun-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues to show a decrease in the number of new cases in hotspots such as Katwa, Beni and Kalunguta health zones. However, in other areas such as Mabalako and Butembo, moderate rates of transmission continue. With ongoing EVD transmission within communities in 12 health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, factors such as persistent delays in case detection, approximately a third of cases dying outside of Ebola treatment or transit centres, and high population mobility, pose a high risk of geographical spread both within the DRC and to neighbouring countries. This was highlighted by the recent exportation of cases to Uganda – the first confirmed cases detected outside of North Kivu and Ituri province since the onset of the outbreak over 10 months ago. For more information, please see Disease Outbreak News on EVD in Uganda

Weekly decrease in the incidence of new cases have been reported in several health zones; however, increase or a continuation of the outbreak has been observed in others (Figure 1). In the 21 days, between 22 May to 11 June 2019, 62 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases, representing 9% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2). During this period, a total of 212 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako (33%, n=69), Butembo (18%, n=39), Katwa (14%, n=30) Mandima (11%, n=23) and Beni (9%, n=20). Single confirmed cases were also reported from Rwampara and Komanda health zones this past week following a prolonged period since the last reported case, with both cases acquiring the infection in the aforementioned hotspots.

As of 11 June 2019, a total of 2084 EVD cases, including 1990 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1405 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1311 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2084 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 57% (1194) were female, and 29% (605) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 118 (6% of total cases).

Taking these recent events into consideration, the WHO Director-General will convene the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) on 14 June 2019. The independent group of public health experts will provide their views to the Director-General on whether the event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). If the event is determined to constitute a PHEIC, the Director-General will issue Temporary Recommendations, which are usually health measures aimed at reducing the international spread of Ebola and avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic. A statement giving an account of the meeting and its conclusions will be posted on the WHO website immediately after the meeting.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases were observed from February through mid-May 2019, with lower though still substantial rates since then. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, especially over the past four weeks, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. In order to ensure staff safety and security, security mitigation measures are being enhanced, and procedural, operational, and physical security challenges are being addressed. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigate local spread. These efforts must continue to be scaled-up.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for travellers to/from the affected countries. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Included in today's tally are five repatriated Congolese patients who were identified in Uganda earlier this week, when a 5-year-old boy became the first person in Uganda to be diagnosed as having Ebola during this outbreak. The boy died yesterday from the disease, as has his grandmother.

An infection in his 3-year-old brother brings the cluster to eight cases, all of which are now classified as cases in Mabalako health zone by DRC health officials.

The boy—whose grandfather died of Ebola in Mabalako—and several members of his family were identified at border crossings between the two countries and initially seen and treated in Kasese, Uganda, about 140 kilometers (85 miles) from Beni, DRC.

The DRC today also confirmed 6 new Ebola deaths, bringing the outbreak fatality total to 1,411. Officials are tracking 335 suspected cases.

UNICEF response

Today UNICEF announced the launch of an emergency response plan in Uganda, which will cost $3.9 million and focus on communication, education, and sanitation.

""As our thoughts are with this young boy's family, this is a tragic reminder that even one case of Ebola is one too many,"" said UNICEF Representative in Uganda, Doreen Mulenga, MD in a press release.

""We must do everything possible to stop this outbreak in its tracks and prevent other needless deaths. UNICEF is intensifying its efforts to do so and minimize this outbreak’s potentially devastating impact on children and communities at-large in Uganda.""

Uganda confirms 3 cases, with 1 suspected

According to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Uganda office, there are three confirmed cases of Ebola in that country and one suspected case—involving a 23-year-old man. The confirmed cases are the index patient, his grandmother, and the boy's brother, who is being treated.

Officials are following 27 case contacts and will administer 400 donated doses of rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in a ring vaccination effort around the case contacts. The DRC donated the vaccine to Ugandan health officials, and the ring vaccination campaign is expected to start tomorrow.

For months, Ugandan officials have prepared for an Ebola patient crossing into the country. Throughout the week, leaders have taken to Twitter to reaffirm their country's ability to handle the outbreak.

""We appeal to the public and malicious individuals to desist from spreading false rumors about the Ebola outbreak generally and on social media,"" said Jane Ruth Aceng, MD, Uganda's minister of health in a statement posted to Twitter. ""The outbreak is REAL and we urge all residents of Uganda to remain vigilant.""

Three more health workers infected in DRC

Today the DRC's health ministry confirmed that one of the new cases involves a vaccinated health worker in Mabalako.

Yesterday the ministry confirmed that 2 of 13 newly recorded cases were in unvaccinated health workers in Mabalako. One of those health workers died in in the health center where he was working, which officials consider a community death.

There are now 116 health workers infected during this outbreak, including 38 deaths.

DRC officials today said ring vaccination in their country continues, with 133,328 people so far vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed vaccine.

WHO experts to meet tomorrow

Tomorrow the WHO's Ebola emergency committee will meet to discuss the new cases in Uganda and assess if the situation now warrants a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under International Health Regulations.

The group declined to designate the outbreak a PHEIC in two previous meetings.

Also today, the European Union (EU) announced an additional funding package of €3.5 million ($3.95 million), of which €2.5 million ($2.82 million) is for Uganda and €1 million ($1.13 million) for South Sudan. This is in addition to the €17 million ($19.16 million) the EU has already given to the DRC since 2018.

""Our funding is helping with surveillance, work with local communities, and boosting local capacities for these countries to take timely and effective action. We are committed to continue our assistance to bring this outbreak to an end, for as long as it takes,"" said Christos Stylianides, the commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis management and EU Ebola, in a press release.

Jun 12 WHO Uganda situation report

Jun 13 EU press release","Uganda has banned public gatherings in western Kasese district as officials attempt to contain an Ebola outbreak which has killed two people in the country days after the virus spread from the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

Emmanuel Ainebyona, a Health Ministry spokesman, confirmed the move on Thursday hours after officials declared that a 50-year-old Congolese woman had become the second patient to die of the disease in Uganda.

Her five-year-old grandson was the first confirmed Ebola death in Uganda. The boy's three-year-old brother is also infected and is currently undergoing treatment.

The three individuals were part of a family group that travelled to DRC to care for a relative, who also died of Ebola, before returning to Uganda.

The infections marked the first confirmed cross-border cases of the virus in the current epidemic, which was previously confined to the eastern DRC's North Kivu and Ituri provinces after emerging 10 months ago.

More than 2,000 cases have been recorded in the DRC since the start of the outbreak in August, the country's 10th to date, and more than 1,400 people have died.

An expert World Health Organization (WHO) committee will convene in the Swiss city of Geneva on Friday to weigh whether to declare the epidemic a global health emergency following its spread into Uganda. Such declarations almost always boost global attention and lead to an increase in aid.

Two previous WHO emergency meetings decided the outbreak was not yet fit for a declaration of global emergency despite being of ""deep concern"".

DRC repatriates five patients

Ugandan Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng said as of Thursday afternoon there was ""no confirmed case"" of the Ebola virus in the country after DRC officials succesfully repatriated five infected people earlier in the day.

Three people suspected to have contracted the disease are being treated in isolation at the Kasese district's Bwera Ebola Treatment Unit, Aceng added, while health workers were establishing contact with 27 people believed to have come into contact with the two deceased.

As of now,there is NO confirmed case of Ebola in Uganda.

However, 3 suspected cases remain in isolation at Bwera Ebola Treatment Unit

Uganda and the wider East Africa region have been on high Ebola alert since the start of the epidemic.

In a precautionary move, Uganda has vaccinated some 4,700 health workers in more than 150 facilities with an experimental drug designed to protect them against the virus, which spreads through contact with bodily fluids of those infected, causing haemorrhagic fever with severe vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding.

Among those vaccinated are the members of a rapid response team who have been deployed to Kasese to trace likely cases and vaccinate those who might have come into contact with any people who have contracted the disease.

The vaccine is experimental but is estimated to be 97.5 percent effective and, according to the WHO, may protect a person for up to 12 months.

'Not under control'

Experts have long feared Ebola could spread from the eastern DRC to neighbouring countries, with regional insecurity and deep community mistrust hampering emergency responders' efforts.

More than 100 attacks on treatment centres and health workers in DRC have been recorded since the beginning of this year, according to the WHO.

Last week, the United Nations agency warned that a quarter of all cases in the outbreak may be going undetected, with scores of victims dying without having been admitted to Ebola treatment centres.

Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, cautioned the epidemic was ""not out of control, but it is certainly not under control"".

The world's worst epidemic of Ebola, a haemorrhagic fever, killed about 11,300 people in West Africa as it raced through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia from 2013 to 2016.",no result found,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Authorities repatriated the relatives of two people who died of Ebola in Uganda back to the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, including a 3-year-old boy confirmed to be suffering from the disease, the Ugandan health minister said.

The cases marked the first time the virus has crossed an international border since the current outbreak began in Congo last August. The epidemic has already killed 1,390 people in eastern Congo.

The family sent home on Thursday had crossed from Congo to Uganda earlier this week and sought treatment when a 5-year-old boy became unwell. He died of Ebola on Tuesday. His 50-year-old grandmother, who was accompanying them, died of the disease on Wednesday, the ministry said.

They were the first confirmed deaths in Uganda in the current Ebola outbreak.

The dead boy’s father, mother, 3-year-old brother and their 6-month-old baby, along with the family’s maid, were all repatriated, the minister’s statement said.

The 3-year-old has been confirmed to be infected with Ebola. His 23-year-old Ugandan father has displayed symptoms but tested negative, Ugandan authorities said.

“Uganda remains in Ebola response mode to follow up the 27 contacts (of the family),” the statement said.

Three other suspected Ebola cases not related to the family remain in isolation, the ministry said.

The viral disease spreads through contact with bodily fluids, causing hemorrhagic fever with severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding.

UGANDA PRECAUTIONS

Authorities in neighboring Uganda and South Sudan have been on high alert in case the disease spreads.

On Thursday, Uganda banned public gatherings in the Kasese district where the family crossed the border. Residents are also taking precautions, local journalist Ronald Kule told Reuters.

“They are a little alarmed now and they realize that the risk of catching Ebola is now real,” he said.

“Hand washing facilities have been put in place, with washing materials like JIK (bleach) and soap. There’s no shaking of hands, people just wave at each other.”

At the border, health workers checked lines of people and isolate one child with a raised temperature, a Reuters journalist said.

Uganda has already vaccinated many frontline health workers and is relatively well prepared to contain the virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) sent 3,500 doses of a Merck experimental vaccine to Uganda this week, following 4,700 initial doses.

Dr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s emergencies program, said that he expected Uganda to approve the use of experimental therapeutic drug treatments, to be shipped “in coming days”.

Monitoring and vaccination had been stepped up, but there had been “no panic reaction” so far to the cases there.

The WHO has said it will reconvene an emergency committee on Friday to decide whether the outbreak is an international public health emergency and how to manage it.

Authorities have struggled to contain the disease partly because health workers have been attacked nearly 200 times this year in conflict-hit eastern Congo, the epicenter of the outbreak.","An Ebola health worker is seen at a treatment center in Beni, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Uganda on Tuesday confirmed a child there has been diagnosed with Ebola, the first cross-border case from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where a large outbreak has raged for the last 10 months.

Five family members traveling with the child, a 5-year-old, are also ill and have been tested for Ebola, Ugandan Health Minister Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng said. Those test results are pending.

The news will likely increase pressure on the World Health Organization to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The agency’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told STAT he will convene an advisory body — called an emergency committee — as quickly as possible to review the situation and decide whether the outbreak now poses a global health threat.

advertisement

Dr. Mike Ryan, who heads the WHO’s emergencies program, said the meeting will likely occur within the next day or two, after the agency consults with the governments of Uganda and DRC.

Ryan said Uganda and partners have been working for months to protect the border area against just this type of event. “It’s never good news to have Ebola,” he said, but suggested the preparatory work should help contain the threat.

The infected child crossed into Uganda with his family in Bwera, near the Congolese city of Butembo. The Congolese Health Ministry said the family was traveling from Mabalako. Both Mabalako and Butembo have experienced intense Ebola transmission of late.

The boy’s mother is Congolese but his father is Ugandan; they live in Uganda, near the border. The family had traveled to DRC to see the woman’s father. He died from Ebola in late May.

A group of 14 family members set off to return to Uganda, arriving at a village called Kasindi near the border on June 10. Of the group, seven are children, ranging in age from 7 months to 12 years of age.

When they arrived at Kasindi, 12 members of the group were experiencing symptoms, and they stopped there at a health facility. They were directed to an isolation center, but then six members of the family fled the facility, crossing into Uganda, said the Congolese Health Ministry, which alerted Ugandan authorities of the family’s movements. The group that crossed the border included the boy, his mother, and four others.

The WHO’s country office for Uganda said that after crossing the border, the group sought care at a hospital in Kagando, where health workers recognized the boy was likely infected with Ebola.

The boy was transferred to an Ebola treatment center at Bwera, one of the facilities Uganda has set up in anticipation of the possibility of seeing cases imported from DRC. He was tested for the virus there.

For months, DRC’s neighbors have been preparing for the possibility that a case arising from the outbreak in DRC could spill into their territories, with Uganda, South Sudan, and Rwanda vaccinating health workers in health facilities near their borders with DRC. Vaccination of health workers in parts of Burundi is also planned.

Uganda has vaccinated nearly 5,000 health workers at 165 health facilities, including both the one where the boy is being treated, and the one at Kagando where his family first stopped for care.

The WHO said Uganda’s health ministry has dispatched rapid response teams to the area in a bid to ensure the virus is contained. Tedros told STAT the WHO is also sending supplies of vaccine to Uganda in case it’s needed. Ryan said eight potential contacts of this group on the Ugandan side of the border have been identified so far.

The outbreak in northeastern DRC is the second largest on record. To date, there have been 2,071 cases and 1,396 deaths. The outbreak is believed to have started in late April 2018 but was only recognized as Ebola at the end of July.

Twice so far Tedros, as the WHO director general is known, has convened an emergency committee to advise him on whether the outbreak constitutes a global health threat. Both times they concluded it did not, pointing specifically to the lack of international spread.

The emergency committee has also warned that declaring a public health emergency might actually complicate the job of stopping the outbreak, which is occurring in a conflict zone."
14-Jun-19,no result found,The situation of the Ebola epidemic in the DRC continues to improve with a decrease in cases in the main HWCszKwuIRfu,The Ebola outbreak in North Kivu is an emergency for DRC amp the region but not yet the world WHO Emergency Commit httpstcoJcNjSn490A,"A World Health Organization (WHO) emergency committee convened in the wake of imported Ebola cases in Uganda said today that the situation still doesn't warrant a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), but they did express serious worries about the threat to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and its neighbors and over a lack of funds.

In a statement released at the end of its deliberations—the third time the group has met since the outbreak began last August—the committee said the cluster of cases in Uganda isn't surprising, and the country's rapid response underscores the importance of preparedness in neighboring countries.

Though the outbreak is a health emergency in the DRC and the immediate region, it doesn't meet all three criteria for a PHEIC under the International Health Regulations (IHR). And the experts say that formal temporary recommendations under the IHR would not enhance current response operations.

Risk of global spread still low

In a statement, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said though the spread of Ebola to Uganda is a new development, it doesn't signal a shift in outbreak dynamics.

""We have the people, the tools, the knowledge, and the determination to end this outbreak,"" he said. ""We need the sustained political commitment of all parties, so we can safely access and work with communities. We also need the international community to step up its financial commitment to ending the outbreak.""

Tedros is in Kinshasa today meeting with top officials in the DRC and will next visit the outbreak region before traveling on to Uganda to assess the latest developments.

At a media telebriefing today, the committee's acting chair, Preben Aavitsland, MD, senior consultant and infectious disease specialist at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said the group concluded that the risk of international spread is still low and that there is nothing to gain by recommending a PHEIC. He added that there was potentially a lot to lose in declaring a PHEIC, such as the risk of airlines stopping flights, border closures, or other restrictive measures that could hurt the DRC's economy.

To declare a PHEIC as a means to raise funds for the outbreak response would be a misuse of the process, health officials said.

Deep concerns over funding

Aavitsland said committee members are deeply disappointed that the WHO and its response partners haven't received enough funding and resources to battle Ebola. Currently, $98 million is needed to support the response through July, but so far health officials have received only $43.6 million, resulting in a $54 million gap.

Mike Ryan, MD, the WHO's executive director of emergency programs, said there has been very little funding available to help the DRC's four closest neighbors prepare for imported Ebola cases—and there's still a $27 million shortfall in that support.

In its recommendations today, the emergency committee also tweaked its public health advice, including a recommendation that countries most at risk put approvals in place for investigational medicines and vaccines.

Uganda monitoring 4 suspected cases

A 3-year-old boy who is one of Uganda's recently confirmed Ebola cases and three members of his family are back in the DRC where experimental treatments are available, and there are no active cases in Uganda, according to the latest updates from the WHO and Uganda's health ministry.

Four people with suspected infections, however, are still in Uganda and are receiving care at the Bwera Ebola treatment center, and 98 contacts are being monitored.

At today's media briefing, Ryan said ring vaccination in Uganda is expected to begin tomorrow, now that health officials have a comprehensive list of contacts and contacts of contacts who are eligible to be vaccinated.

In a statement yesterday detailing the Ebola events in Uganda, the WHO said health workers at both facilities where Uganda's first imported case, involving the 5-year-old boy, was treated, had been previously vaccinated.

WHO officials added that, since Nov 7, Uganda has vaccinated 4,699 healthcare and frontline workers as part of its Ebola preparedness activities and noted that nine Ebola treatment units are in place in districts that border the DRC's Ituri and North Kivu provinces.

Given the close epidemiologic links of Uganda's three cases and its high level of preparedness, the WHO said the overall risk to the country is moderate and the risk posed to the region by the new cases in Uganda—with no signs of local transmission at this point—is low.

DRC total rises by 12

The DRC's health ministry today confirmed 12 more Ebola cases, raising the total to 2,120. Two of the cases are in Biena, an earlier affected area. The others are in Mabalako, Kalunguta, Rwampara, and Mandima. Health officials are still investigating 322 suspected cases.

Nine more people died from their Ebola infections, two in community settings and seven in Ebola treatment centers. The deaths push the outbreak's fatality count to 1,420.

In its weekly snapshot of Ebola activity in the DRC yesterday, the WHO said cases are declining in some hot spots such as Katwa, Beni, and Kalunguta, but continue at a moderate pace in others, such as Mabalako and Butembo.

""Recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts,"" the WHO said.

Health officials are still worried about persistent delays in detecting cases and the many Ebola deaths in the community, which raise the risk virus spread. About one third of Ebola patients are dying outside of transit centers or Ebola treatment centers.

Also, the WHO said cases continue to rise among health workers, with 118 infected so far.

Boosting vaccine production

WHO officials said today that Merck, which makes the VSV-EBOV vaccine, recently announced plans to begin producing the vaccine at its facility in West Point, Pennsylvania, in addition to its facility in Germany.

At the WHO media briefing today, Ryan said WHO officials welcome the new development, which will double vaccine capacity.

Currently, the company has 250,000 doses ready to ship and expects to make 100,000 more by the end of the year.

The World Health Organization confirms more than 2,000 infections since the most recent Ebola outbreak in August 2018 in the Democratic Republic of Congo.",no result found,"GENEVA (Reuters) - A World Health Organization panel decided on Friday not to declare an international emergency over Congo’s Ebola outbreak despite its spread to Uganda this week, concluding such a declaration could cause too much economic harm.

Congo’s epidemic is the second worst ever, with 2,108 cases of Ebola and 1,411 deaths since last August. This week, it reached Uganda, where three cases were recorded, all in people who had arrived from Congo. Two of them died.

In a statement, the panel of 13 independent medical experts on the WHO’s Emergency Committee urged neighboring “at risk” countries to improve their preparedness for detecting and managing imported cases, “as Uganda has done”.

“This is not a global emergency, it is an emergency in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a severe emergency and it may affect neighboring counties,” Dr. Preben Aavitsland, the panel’s acting chair, told a news conference at the U.N. agency’s headquarters in Geneva.

“It was the view of the Committee that there is really nothing to gain by declaring a PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern), but there is potentially a lot to lose.”

Such a declaration would risk creating restrictions on travel or trade “that could severely harm the economy in the Democratic Republic of Congo,” Aavitsland said.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, speaking by telephone from Kampala, said: “The spread of Ebola to Uganda is a new development but the fundamental dynamics of the outbreak haven’t changed.”

Ugandan authorities have now drawn up a list of 98 contacts, or contacts of contacts, potentially exposed to the Ebola virus, of whom 10 are considered “high risk”, said Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s emergencies program.

Vaccination of those contacts and health workers with a Merck experimental vaccine is to start on Saturday, he said.

Some medical groups had urged the committee to declare an emergency which would have led to boosting public health measures, funding and resources.

Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust medical charity and a specialist in infectious diseases, voiced disappointment that the panel had failed to declare an emergency for the third time.

“I respect the advice of the emergency committee but do believe a Public Health Emergency of International Concern would have been justified,” Farrar said in a statement.

He added that declaring an emergency would have raised levels of international political support “which has been lacking to date”, and enhanced diplomatic, public health, security and logistic efforts.

Only four emergencies have been declared in the past decade, including the worst ever Ebola outbreak, which hit West Africa in 2014-2016. The others were an influenza pandemic in 2009, polio in 2014 and the Zika virus in 2016.

Ryan told Reuters on Friday that there had been no sign of local transmission of Ebola virus in Uganda.

“No evidence yet... But we’re not out of the woods yet,” he said, noting that the incubation period is up to 21 days.","People crossing the DRC-Uganda border near Kasindi, in eastern Congo, have their temperature taken on Wednesday to check for symptoms of Ebola.

This story has been updated throughout.

With confirmation that the long-running outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo had spilled across the country’s eastern border to enmesh Uganda in the epidemic, partners in the Ebola containment effort moved Wednesday to ramp up their responses.

The World Health Organization announced Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has convened a panel of outside experts to advise him on whether the outbreak should be declared a public health emergency of international concern. The so-called emergency committee will meet on Friday.

In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it was activating its emergency operations center to better coordinate its contribution to the containment effort.

The move allows the agency to dedicate staff full time to the response, and to shift people from other jobs if additional expertise is needed. But the move does not signify that the risk to the United States has risen in any way, said CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield.

“The most important thing that we can do at CDC … is to detect, respond, and prevent outbreaks at their source,” Redfield told STAT. CDC has a large country office in Uganda and has 15 people deployed to DRC to help with the outbreak response.

Inger Damon, chief strategy officer for CDC’s Ebola response, said some staff from the Uganda office traveled with ministry of health officials to the area where the cases are being cared for to take part in the assessment of the situation.

“As that information comes back, there’ll be decisions made in terms of, are there additional areas where CDC can support, whether that’s in laboratory work, whether it’s in some of the response operations,” Damon said.

Redfield noted the CDC, the WHO, and other partners in the Ebola response have been preparing DRC’s neighbors for months to be ready in case the virus spread across their borders.

Those preparations were put to the test Monday when a family returning to Uganda after attending the funeral of a man who died from Ebola in DRC went to a hospital in Kagando looking for care for a 5-year-old boy. With the boy were his mother and father, his grandmother, two younger siblings, and another member of the party. A number of them were ill.

Staff at the hospital suspected Ebola and sent the group to an Ebola treatment center at Bwera that the health ministry had established in anticipation of cases coming across the border.

The 5-year-old was the first in the group to test positive; he died later Tuesday night. His grandmother, 50, and 3-year-old brother also tested positive. The rest of the group is under observation.

Somewhat remarkably, these are the first confirmed cases of Ebola linked to this outbreak that have been found outside of DRC, though the outbreak has raged for more than 10 months in two provinces located on the country’s borders with Uganda, South Sudan, and Rwanda. Thousands of people cross the border between DRC and Uganda daily.

To date, DRC has recorded 2,084 in the outbreak and 1,405 deaths. This is the second largest Ebola outbreak on record.

Health authorities from Uganda and DRC as well as leaders of the response effort met in Bwera on Wednesday to work on plans for a coordinated response. The DRC contingent brought 400 doses of the experimental Ebola vaccine, and Uganda’s health minister, Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng, said that vaccination of people who had contact with the family would begin on Friday.

Ugandan health authorities have been working for months to prepare health facilities along its border with DRC to respond to Ebola. Nearly 5,000 health workers in 165 health facilities have been vaccinated, including those at two health facilities where this boy and his family went for care.

The family lives in Uganda, but the boy’s mother is Congolese. They had traveled to Mabalako, one of the hot spots for Ebola transmission in DRC, to see her ailing father, who had contracted Ebola. He died in on June 1.

Earlier this week, a party of 14 members of this family, including seven children under the age of 12, set off to return to Uganda. A dozen of them were reportedly ill, and stopped at a health clinic on the DRC side of the border. From there they were taken to an isolation center, but six members of the group fled and crossed into Uganda.

Congolese health officials alerted Ugandan authorities to be on the lookout for the family.

The Congolese health minister reported Wednesday that five more members of the family group who had stayed in DRC tested positive for Ebola. Contact tracing to locate and monitor the health of 50 people in Uganda and 80 people in DRC has begun."

Al Jazeera's Mohamad ElBardicy reports.",no result found,no result found,"A mother nurses her newborn at a maternity ward in eastern Sierra Leone during the 2016 Ebola outbreak. An effective vaccine that is now being used to fight the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo should be offered to women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

In the midst of a deadly epidemic like Ebola, who should get an experimental vaccine that provides protection against the disease 97.5% of the time?

The obvious candidates would be immediate contacts of people who developed Ebola, and their contacts. Yet an entire group of vulnerable individuals who fall into these categories — women who are pregnant or who are breastfeeding infants — are being denied this lifesaving intervention.

The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, which is being developed by Merck, has not yet been approved for commercial use. The vaccine is currently being used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where more than 2,000 people have been infected with the Ebola virus and close to 1,400 have died, making this the world’s second-largest Ebola outbreak.

advertisement

So far, more than 130,000 people in the DRC outbreak have received rVSV-ZEBOV using what’s called a ring vaccination approach: The vaccine is offered to contacts of people diagnosed with Ebola, their contacts, and front-line workers — unless they are pregnant or lactating. More than 300 pregnant women and more than 600 breastfeeding women identified as contacts since the vaccination campaign began have been denied the opportunity to get rVSV-ZEBOV.

One rationale for withholding the vaccine from women who are pregnant or lactating is that the vaccine had not been tested in this group to evaluate its effects on the fetus or breastfeeding children.

In February, the DRC announced that women who are pregnant and lactating, as well as children under the age of 1, should be offered access to rVSV-ZEBOV, reversing a previous decision that had drawn fire from public health experts.

Last week, an ethics committee of the University of Kinshasa’s School of Public Health endorsed this strategy by approving an amendment to the vaccination protocol, allowing vaccination of pregnant contacts who are beyond the first trimester of pregnancy and those who are lactating.

This is an encouraging step forward, and one we hope will quickly translate into ensuring that pregnant and lactating women who can benefit from the vaccine will get it.

But it doesn’t go far enough. We believe that the criteria for offering the vaccine should apply regardless of pregnancy or lactation status: The vaccine should be offered not only to pregnant and lactating women who are contacts of those diagnosed with Ebola, but also to pregnant and lactating health care workers, and to pregnant and lactating women who are the contacts of contacts. To guide future vaccination efforts, data should be collected on pregnancy outcomes. We also believe that pregnant women should be offered the vaccine regardless of trimester.

There are compelling reasons why it is critical that pregnant women not be excluded from current Ebola vaccination strategies. Not only do pregnant women become infected with Ebola, but women appear to have higher rates of infection than men, either because of their traditional role as caregivers for ill family members or because of an increased susceptibility to the virus.

The risk for death is at least as high among Ebola-infected pregnant women as among women who are not pregnant, and may be higher. In addition to the risk posed to the pregnant woman herself, it is also important to consider the benefits and risks of vaccination for the fetus and newborn, since Ebola infection during pregnancy presents serious threats to their health: Pregnant women infected with Ebola are at very high risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death.

Given the risk of Ebola to pregnant women and their babies, the benefits of their receiving the vaccine to prevent Ebola illness and death are clear.

To be sure, weighing the potential risks of the vaccine on a pregnant woman and her fetus is complicated. No data are available on the effects of this experimental Ebola vaccine on pregnant women or on their fetuses. There are, however, many years of experience with other vaccines in pregnancy that may help frame this issue.

For many years, pregnant women in developing countries have been given the tetanus toxoid vaccine to prevent babies from dying of tetanus, and there is no evidence of harmful effects on the fetus. Inactivated influenza vaccine along with tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (known collectively as Tdap) are routinely recommended during pregnancy. Not only have these vaccines been shown to be safe, but they have an added benefit: Antibodies produced by the mother cross the placenta to the fetus, providing the newborn with protection against influenza and pertussis, both deadly illnesses in infants, for the first few months of life.

The experimental Ebola vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, and live vaccines have historically not been given during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk that the weakened virus might cross the placenta and infect the fetus. Yet when pregnant women have inadvertently been vaccinated with live vaccines, no harmful effects have been observed. And recommendations for one live vaccine — the yellow fever vaccine — emphasize weighing the risks and benefits for pregnant women, given the severity of illness potentially prevented by the vaccine.

Lessons from dolutegravir, a treatment for HIV

A recent experience with a new HIV medication called dolutegravir offers some guidance here. Dolutegravir has been recognized as having many benefits for treatment of HIV, given its ability to clear the virus quickly and consistently with fewer side effects and lower cost. Yet its use was limited among pregnant women due to concerns about fetal safety.

In July of 2018, interim data from a study in Botswana suggested that women who take dolutegravir early in pregnancy might be at increased risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida or anencephaly. While waiting for more data, recommendations were made that women who are planning a pregnancy or who aren’t using consistent contraception should not take dolutegravir.

Since then, modeling data have suggested that even if dolutegravir does cause neural tube defects, women are less likely to die and their children would be more likely to be alive and HIV-free if given this drug because its benefits outweigh the risks. Perhaps more important, following a stakeholder meeting of African women living with HIV to discuss the safety signal, the group issued this powerful consensus statement: “It is critical to not just view a pregnant mother, or any women of childbearing potential, as a vessel for a baby, but as an individual in her own right, who deserves access to the very best, evidence-based treatment available and the right to be adequately informed to make a choice that she feels is best for her.”

Subsequent guidance for the use of dolutegravir has recognized this issue: The WHO currently recommends that women should be counseled regarding the potential benefits and risks of dolutegravir and allowed to choose to use it or an alternative drug.

For women at high risk for contracting Ebola, rVSV-ZEBOV represents an even more stark example of a potentially lifesaving intervention. Ebola kills women and their babies. There is an ethical obligation to not exclude women from a protective intervention like rVSV-ZEBOV because they are pregnant or lactating. They should be given the best available information to make a decision about being vaccinated and, if they choose to go forward, should be offered the Ebola vaccine regardless of pregnancy or lactation status.

Since the identification of thalidomide as a cause of limb defects in the 1960s, clinicians and researchers have emphasized protecting the fetus from harmful exposures. While this is a laudable goal, pregnancy shouldn’t automatically exclude women from receiving lifesaving therapies. Pregnant women and their fetuses deserve the opportunity to be protected from severe disease and death. As with the general population, the focus needs to remain on the benefits of the intervention and whether those outweigh the potential risks.

Based on what is known about the severe effects of Ebola virus on a woman and her fetus and preliminary data on the effectiveness of the Ebola vaccine, the benefits of Ebola vaccine outweigh the potential risks, even during the first trimester when the fetus’s organs are forming.

The way forward should be clear: The Ebola vaccine should be offered to lactating and pregnant women regardless of pregnancy trimester to protect women and their fetuses from severe illness and death.

The long-running and dangerous Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — which spilled over into neighboring Uganda this week — is an emergency for the country and a threat to its neighbors, but doesn’t constitute a global health emergency, the World Health Organization concluded on Friday.

The decision, which quickly garnered criticism in some quarters, was made on the recommendation of a panel of outside experts, called an emergency committee.

Dr. Preben Aavitsland, acting chair of the committee and one of the people who wrote the rules governing public health emergencies of international concern after the 2003 SARS outbreak, said there was extensive debate within the group, but in the end they agreed the declaration was not needed and could worsen the situation on the ground.

“This is not a global emergency. It’s an emergency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — a severe emergency. And it may affect neighboring countries,” said Aavitsland, a senior physician at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.

He noted the additional powers that come with an emergency declaration are not needed at this time. It allows the WHO to disclose to other countries information about a disease event even if the country experiencing the outbreak doesn’t wish to share. And it gives the WHO director-general authority to issue temporary recommendations, effectively instructing other countries not to cut off trade and travel with the affected nation.

In previous instances when a public health emergency of international concern — called PHEIC for short — has been declared, the WHO’s recommendations on travel and trade have sometimes been ignored. Countries have interpreted the declaration as a threat. Many, for instance, stopped issuing visas to people from Ebola-affected countries during the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016. And most international airlines stopped flying into those countries.

“So it was the view of the committee that there is really nothing to gain by declaring a PHEIC, but there is potentially a lot to lose,” Aavitsland said.

The WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, on Friday, accepted the committee’s recommendation.

“Although the outbreak does not at this time pose a global health threat, I want to emphasize that for the affected families and communities, this outbreak is very much an emergency,” said Tedros, as he is known. He will travel Saturday to Butembo, one of the recent transmission hot spots and a place where attacks on Ebola response team workers have occurred.

Some global health experts have been calling for months for this outbreak to be declared a PHEIC. The lack of such a declaration is potentially depriving the Ebola response of badly needed assistance and donor cash, they have argued.

The latter is badly needed. The WHO said the response has been hampered by a lack of funding; the agency currently has a $54 million funding gap for this work. Efforts to prepare neighboring countries for cross-border spread, for instance, has not proceeded at the pace it ought to because funding for the work isn’t there, said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s emergencies program, which is leading the response in conjunction with the DRC ministry of health.

Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said the declaration of a PHEIC might have helped on the funding front and would have generated more attention globally for the outbreak.

“I don’t think it should change one iota of what we do” to curtail spread of the virus, he said. “But we live in a political world and we live in a world of communication.”

The North Kivu outbreak likely started in late April 2018 but was only recognized as Ebola in late July. The official declaration that an outbreak was underway in DRC, which had combatted nine earlier Ebola outbreaks, was made on Aug. 1.

Since then, more than 2,100 cases and 1,400 deaths been reported, making this the second largest Ebola outbreak on record. And while it is still less than one-tenth of the size of the massive West African outbreak that ran from 2014 to 2016, it is proving to be potentially more difficult to control.

The epidemic is occurring in northeastern DRC, in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, which hug the country’s borders with South Sudan, Uganda, and Rwanda. The area has been engulfed in conflict for more than two decades, limiting the response’s access to some communities where the virus has been circulating.

Since late February, community anger has been directed at the response teams; at least five workers have been killed. Suddenly an outbreak that was inching downward exploded, with more cases in April and May than in the five previous months combined.

Despite those challenging conditions, the emergency committee decided in mid-April— as it had in October — that an outbreak that hadn’t yet crossed international borders did not meet the criteria to be declared a global health emergency.

This week it did cross a border — into Uganda.

A family — the mother is Congolese, the father Ugandan — were traveling from the funeral of her father, who died of Ebola in DRC. They slipped into Uganda on Monday. First their 5-year-old son, then his grandmother and 3-year-old brother, were diagnosed with Ebola. The older boy and the grandmother died of their infections; the 3-year-old and other family members who traveled with the group were returned to DRC.

Several of DRC’s neighbors have been preparing for months for the possibility that infected people might cross into their territory. Uganda, which has fought five previous Ebola outbreaks, has vaccinated nearly 5,000 health and front-line workers at about 165 health facilities located near the border; it has also built nine Ebola treatment centers near its western border.

Those preparations appear to have paid off this week. The family sought care at a hospital where health workers suspected Ebola and sent the family to one of the treatment centers, at Bwera. The health workers at both facilities had been vaccinated.

But whether any other people in Uganda have contracted the virus in this incident remains to be seen. Several dozen people in Uganda are believed to have had contact with the family. Health authorities there are tracking those people to offer vaccine and monitor their health for three weeks to see whether they will develop the disease.

WHO’s Ryan said 10 high-risk contacts have been identified so far in Uganda and the vaccination effort there will begin Saturday.

In related news, Tedros welcomed an announcement from vaccine manufacturer Merck that it would make an additional 450,000 doses of the experimental Ebola vaccine being used in DRC. More than 130,000 people have been vaccinated so far and there is always concern that supplies of the vaccine, which is not yet being made to commercial scale, will run low.

Merck said that after discussions with the U.S. government and the WHO it would use a U.S.-based plant that makes pilot batches vaccines for the company to manufacture the additional doses. It takes about a year from start to finish to make this vaccine.

The WHO recently learned that it could halve the amount of vaccine given to each person and still get an effective response. Based on the lower dosage, there are currently a quarter-million doses of vaccine at the ready, Ryan said, and a further 100,000 doses will be available by the end of the year."

With nearly 50 cases in 3 days, the outbreak is experiencing another spike in activity following the discovery of cases in neighboring Uganda last week.

According to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Ebola dashboard, the outbreak total now stands at 2,168 cases.

In addition to the newly confirmed cases, there were 19 fatalities over the weekend, including 8 that took place in the community.

In total, 1,440 people have died during this outbreak, which began last August in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Another 319 suspected cases are under investigation.

The new cases come from known hotspots, including 11 in Mabalako, 4 each in Katwa and Mandima, 3 in Kalunguta, 2 in Butembo, and one each in Lubero, Beni, Rwampara, and Musienene.

Ring vaccination begins in Uganda

The DRC confirmed late last week that the 3-year-old brother of Uganda's index case–a 5-year-old boy who traveled with his family from the DRC to Uganda–had died from Ebola upon his arrival at the Ebola treatment center in Beni.

At this time Uganda has extradited all members of the boys' family, some of who were Congolese and some Ugandan, to the DRC. The family had been crossing the border between the two countries to attend the funeral of the boys' grandfather, who died from Ebola in Mabalako.

Over the weekend, Uganda's minister of health, Jane Ruth Aceng, MD, tweeted that a ring vaccination had launched in Kasese district, Uganda, involving an initial 43 case contacts. Non-vaccinated frontline health and other workers were also being vaccinated.

Today WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, is in Uganda to meet with the ministry of health and discuss the Ebola response. Over the weekend, Tedros visited Ebola treatment centers and vaccination clinics in the DRC.

His visits came on the heels of a WHO emergency committee decision last week to hold off on recommendinga public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), for a third time. WHO experts, including Tedros, said the decision was made because the overall risk of international spread is low, and a PHEIC designation could further hurt the DRC's economy.

Two health workers infected

Yesterday the DRC's ministry of health said two health workers, including one in Rwampara and one in Musienene, were newly diagnosed with Ebola. Both workers had refused vaccination with Merck's VSV-EBOV, the unlicensed Ebola vaccine currently being used in the region.

The Musienene health worker died in the community, officials said. The two new cases raise the total number of health workers infected during this outbreak to 118, including 39 deaths. Health workers represent 5.5% of all cases diagnosed since last August.

As of yesterday, a total of 135,395 people in the DRC and neighboring countries had been vaccinated with Merck's vaccine.

Jun 14 CIDRAP News story ""WHO experts again say Ebola not global health emergency""",no result found,no result found,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - At least 161 people have been killed in a northeastern province of Democratic Republic of Congo in the past week, local officials said on Monday, in an apparent resurgence of ethnic clashes between farming and herding communities.

A series of attacks in Ituri province has mostly targeted Hema herders, who have long been in conflict with Lendu farmers over grazing rights and political representation, although the exact identity of the assailants remains murky.

Open conflict between Hema and Lendu from 1999-2007 resulted in an estimated 50,000 deaths in one of the bloodiest chapters of a civil war in eastern Congo that left millions dead from conflict, hunger and disease.

Tit-for-tat attacks between the two groups in late 2017 and early 2018 killed hundreds of people and forced tens of thousands more to flee their homes, but a tenuous calm had taken hold until this month.

Pascal Kakoraki Baguma, a national lawmaker from Ituri, said the latest violence was sparked by the killing last Monday of four Lendu businesspeople.

“Members of the Lendu community believed that these assassinations were the work of the Hema,” Kakoraki said. “This is why they launched several attacks on Hema villages.”

“Sources affirm that 161 bodies have been found so far. But the death toll goes beyond the bodies recovered, as there were other massacres of civilians and police officers,” he said.

Jean Bosco Lalo, president of civil society organizations in Ituri, said 200 bodies had been found since last week in predominantly Hema villages, including the 161 mentioned by Kakoraki. Lalo said the toll would rise once his teams gained access to other villages where killings had been reported.

Ituri Governor Jean Bamanisa said provincial authorities were still working to establish the exact death toll and declined to say who was responsible.

He said the assailants’ tactics were to “empty out the villages, burn them and pursue those who had fled to the surrounding areas with bladed weapons”.

Congo President Felix Tshisekedi, who took office in January, is trying to restore stability to the country’s eastern borderlands, a tinderbox of conflict among armed groups over ethnicity, natural resources and political power.

In developments in Uganda, where three imported cases were recently detected, health officials cleared the use of three experimental treatments so that any other cases confirmed in the country can receive similar Ebola care as in the DRC.

Mabalako emerges as hot spot

Today DRC officials said 4 new cases were in Mandima, 3 in Mabalako, 2 in Butembo, and 1 each in Katwa, Kyondo, Beni, and Kalunguta.

In a daily update late yesterday, the DRC health ministry said the new cases were from seven locations: 14 in Mabalako, and 1 each from Musienene, Beni, Bunia, Rwampara, Kalunguta, and Kyondo.

The ministry said Mabalako has become the outbreak's main hot spot and that response teams there have stepped up their active search for cases to isolate them as quickly as possible to break transmission chains. It also said the new case in Bunia is a contact of an earlier case in Rawmpara health zone who had refused follow-up and vaccination.

The health ministry said the three cases confirmed recently in Uganda will be counted as cases from Mutwanga health zone in the DRC's North Kivu province, since that's where their symptoms began after visiting Mabalako.

Of the 2,181 total cases, 2,087 have been confirmed. Health officials are still investigating 322 suspected cases.

The health ministry said yesterday and today that 19 more people died from Ebola, including 8 in community settings and 11 in Ebola treatment or transit centers. The latest fatal cases life the death count to 1,459.

Security incidents continue

Yesterday, the DRC said a burial team in Bunia was attacked by a group of young people who assaulted them and took their phones and money. All of the team members have been accounted for and the dead body was brought back to the Bunia transit center.

In an update 2 days ago, the DRC noted two other incidents, one the destruction and burning of a sanitary checkpoint during the night in Ituri province and the other an attempted attack by a group of bikers on an infection control and prevention team cleaning up the site of a recently confirmed case in Rwampara health zone. Police dispersed the attackers and the responders were able to complete their work.

Clearance of experimental treatments

On Twitter yesterday, Uganda Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng, MD, announced that officials have received clearance from two government groups to bring experimental Ebola treatments into the country. The groups include the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology and the National Drug Authority.

According to a Reuters story that cited a WHO spokesman, the treatments are ZMapp, Regeneron's REGN-EB3 antibody cocktail, and the antiviral remdesivir.

Uganda doesn't have any active Ebola cases but, in a press release, the health ministry said there are two suspected cases that have been isolated while test results are pending.

Ring vaccination of contacts and contacts of contacts began on Jun 15. And, as of yesterday, 128 contacts and frontline health and response workers had been vaccinated in the latest push.

Jun 18 Reuters story","Ugandan health officials have started a vaccination campaign for people who may have been exposed to Ebola.

The outbreak, one of the worst in history, started in the Democratic Republic of the Congo last year and spread to Uganda earlier this month.

Al Jazeera's Haru Mutasa reports from Entebbe, Uganda.",no result found,"GENEVA (Reuters) - More than 300,000 people have fled inter-ethnic violence in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo since early June, complicating the tracing and treatment of patients at risk from Ebola, U.N. aid agencies said on Tuesday.

At least 161 people have been killed in a northeastern province of Democratic Republic of Congo in the past week, local officials said on Monday, in an apparent resurgence of ethnic clashes between farming and herding communities.

“Violence in northeastern parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo is reported to have displaced more than 300,000 since early June. The situation in Ituri province has deteriorated since the middle of last week, with multiple attacks involving the Hema and Lendu groups,” the U.N. refugee agency spokesman Babar Baloch told a news briefing.

The UNHCR fears that the escalation could engulf large parts of the province, amid reports of killings, kidnappings and sexual violence unleashed against civilians, he said. The government is trying to bring the clashes under control, he added.

As Congolese flee violence at “this massive scale”, fears are that more people will try to seek safety in Uganda, crossing Lake Albert, Baloch said.

An Ebola epidemic in Congo, which spread to Uganda last week, has caused 2,168 infections since August, including 1,449 deaths, with Ituri accounting for about 10 percent of cases and deaths, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said.

“We are always saying the mobility of the population in North Kivu and Ituri is a risk factor,” Jasarevic told the briefing.

“So every time you have people moving in high numbers, it is more complicated to do the work of follow-up, contact tracing, follow up on the people who are supposed basically to be observed on a daily basis for 21 days,” he said, referring to the disease’s incubation period.",no result found

20-Jun-19,"Ebola virus disease – Democratic Republic of the Congo

This week saw a continued, gradual decrease in the number of new Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases from the hotspots of Katwa and Butembo compared to the previous weeks. However, these encouraging signs are offset by a marked increase in case incidence in Mabalako Health Zone, and especially in Aloya Health Area (Figure 1). While the spread of EVD to new geographic areas remains low, in the health zones of Bunia, Lubero, Komanda and Rwampara, recent reintroduction events illustrate the high risks in previously affected areas. Along with the rise in cases in Mabalako, there was also an accompanying increase in healthcare worker (HCW) and nosocomial infections. These findings highlight the ongoing need to comprehensively strengthen the infection prevention and control measures in the various healthcare facilities operating in these areas. The occurrence of EVD infections in these health areas also place a strain on the already limited security resources needed to facilitate access for effective response activities to continue.

In addition to operational challenges encountered on the ground by healthcare workers during the past ten months, the overall EVD outbreak response effort is confronting substantial difficulty in maintaining scale in the context of a US $54 million funding shortage. Without adequate funding to fill this gap, response activities will be compromised, negatively impacting the entire response, resulting in a drastic reduction in vital health services available and a cessation of operations during a critical time of the outbreak. Member States and other donors are strongly encouraged to help meet this funding gap in order to ensure that hard won progress in containing this EVD outbreak will not suffer a potentially devastating setback due to financial limitations.

In the 21 days, between 29 May to 18 June 2019, 62 health areas within 15 health zones reported new cases, representing 9% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2). During this period, a total of 245 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako (37%, n=91), Mandima (12%, n=30), Katwa (11%, n=28), Beni (11%, n=27) , Butembo (9%, n=23) , Kalunguta (5%, n=13) and Musienene (5%, n=12). As of 18 June 2019, a total of 2190 EVD cases, including 2096 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1470 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1376 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2190 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 57% (1242) were female, and 29% (639) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 122 (6% of total cases).

No new EVD cases or deaths have been reported in the Republic of Uganda since the previous EVD Disease Outbreak News publication on 13 June 2019. Response activities are however ongoing, with active case surveillance and over 100 potentially exposed contacts identified, predominately in Kisinga and Bwera subcounties, Kasese District. Contacts will be visited daily for 21 days until the last contact completes follow-up on 2 July. All contacts remain asymptomatic to date. As of 19 June, a total of 456 individuals have been vaccinated in Uganda, including consenting contacts and contacts of contacts.

Following the detection of EVD cases in Uganda, on 14 June 2019, a meeting of the Emergency Committee was convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR). The Committee expressed its deep concern about the ongoing outbreak, which, despite some positive epidemiological trends, especially in the epicentres of Butembo and Katwa, shows that the extension and/or reinfection of disease in other areas like Mabalako. This presents, once again, challenges around community acceptance and security. In addition, the response continues to be hampered by a lack of adequate funding and strained human resources. It was noted that the cluster of cases in Uganda is not unexpected; the rapid response and initial containment is a testament to the importance of preparedness in neighbouring countries. It was the view of the Committee that the outbreak is a health emergency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region, but does not meet all the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee provided public health advice, which it strongly urged countries and responding partners to heed. For the full statement and further details, please click here.

Public health response

For further detailed information about the public health response actions by the MoH, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:

WHO risk assessment

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases were observed from February through mid-May 2019, with lower though still substantial rates since then. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, especially over the past four weeks, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions. However, recent community dialogue, outreach initiatives, and restoration of access to certain hotspot areas have resulted in some improvements in community acceptance of response activities and case investigation efforts. In order to ensure staff safety and security, security mitigation measures are being enhanced, and procedural, operational, and physical security challenges are being addressed. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources. Conversely, substantive operational readiness and preparedness activities in a number of neighbouring countries have likely increased capacity to rapidly detect cases and mitigate local spread. These efforts must continue to be scaled-up.

WHO advice

WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for travellers to/from the affected countries. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

In other developments, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, who just returned from his ninth trip the DRC since the outbreak began, called for bipartisan political cooperation in the DRC to end the outbreak and appealed to the global community for more money to support the response.

Cases top 2,200

Yesterday the DRC's health ministry reported 9 new cases, and in an update today it reported 14 new illnesses: 8 in Beni, 7 in Mabalako, 3 in Kalunguta, 2 in Mandima, and 1 each in Alimbongo, Katwa, and Musienene. The new confirmations raise the outbreak total to 2,204 cases. Health officials are still investigating 349 suspected infections.

In its latest two daily updates the ministry said yesterday that 20 more people died from Ebola, 6 in community settings and 14 in Ebola treatment centers. The outbreak's fatality count now stands at 1,479. Officials are tracking 349 suspected cases.

Concern over hospital infections, reintroductions

Though infection levels have dropped in Katwa and Butembo, there's been a marked increase in Mabalako health zone, especially in Alyoa health area, the WHO said today in its weekly snapshot of outbreak activity.

Along with Mabalako's rise in activity, healthcare worker and hospital-related infections were reported, underscoring the need to strengthen infection prevention and control practices in the outbreak region's health facilities.

The WHO also raised concerns about Ebola reintroductions in Bunia, Lubero, Komanda, and Rwampara, which highlights ongoing threats to those locations and a strain on already limited security resources that responders need to do their work.

In Uganda, more than 100 contacts of the earlier imported cases have been identified, and so far all are asymptomatic. As of Jun 19, the WHO said 456 people in Uganda have been vaccinated with VSV-EBOV, Merck's unlicensed vaccine.

Call for bipartisan, financial support

During recent meeting in Kinshasa, Tedros met with the DRC's prime minister, opposition leaders, religious officials, and other partners, the WHO said in a statement yesterday. He also traveled to Butembo, which has been one of the main epicenters, to meet with community and religious leaders, business representatives, and nongovernmental organization representatives.

Other stops included Katwa, to launch a new vaccination protocol to reach more people, including pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and children over 6 months old. Also, in the wake of a recent trio of imported cases, he visited top government and health officials in Uganda.

Regarding the situation in the DRC, Tedros said political cooperation must cross party lines and borders. ""Bipartisan political leadership in DRC is the only way that communities will eventually understand the threat of Ebola and take ownership in ending the outbreak.""

Also, he strongly appealed to other countries across the world to support the health responders in the DRC. Tedros said the WHO needs $98 million to fund the response, but it has received only $44 million, leaving a $54 million gap, a shortfall he said must immediate be addressed.

""If the funds are not received, WHO will be unable to sustain the response at the current scale,"" he said, adding that other partners face funding gaps and that response decisions risk being driven by financial capacity rather than operational needs.

WHO online Ebola dashboard","Kampala, Uganda - In July last year, Maska Wizine's brother-in-law, a journalist, was killed when rebels attacked a radio station he worked at in the Beni area of North Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

He was the only person in the station that day, but the rebels also killed three more people in the neighbourhood. Later, when residents thought the rebels had left the area, they went into the station and retrieved his body for burial.

At the funeral, which was well attended because the journalist was well known, the rebels struck again, scattering the mourners into hiding.

Wizine says they killed those who could not run or hide fast enough.

""Very many. Over 40 people,"" the 31-year-old mother of four said.

She knew then she had to leave the area but she stuck it out for another nine months.

By the end of February this year, rebel attacks in the area were so frequent that ordinary life was impossible.

""If they found you heading to the garden, they would hack you into pieces,"" Wizine said.

Journey to safety

On March 2, following a rebel attack on her village, Wizine left with her youngest child, a seven-year-old boy, and her twin sister.

From March and April, the three travelled from Beni through Bunia to Tchomia, where they got onto a boat to Uganda, entering at Sebagoro on the shores of Lake Albert on May 3.

They were among about 25,000 refugees to enter Uganda from the DRC this year alone.

In total, the country hosts more than 345,000 Congolese refugees, and that's only its second-largest refugee population.

""There's not a single day when we don't receive refugees. Last week we received more than 1,000 from DRC alone,"" says Dunia Aslam Khan, the spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in the country.

Ensconced between at least three active conflicts in the Great Lakes region and proud of its open-door policy, Uganda's refugee population has since 2016 sharply risen to more than one million.

The country hosts more than 825,000 South Sudanese refugees and nearly 105,000 from countries such as Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan and Ethiopia - in addition to the Congolese.

Ebola's spread

With the ongoing Congolese influx comes another worry: Ebola.

Beni, where Wizine came from, is the second-worst hit area in the ongoing Ebola epidemic in the DRC.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the area has had 332 confirmed cases of Ebola since the outbreak in August 2018 and transmission is ongoing with 20 confirmed cases between the end of May and mid-June 2019.

When Wizine was still in Beni, she occasionally saw health workers passing through on Ebola-sensitisation efforts.

""They told us not to shake hands when we greet and to keep proper hygiene,"" she recalls.

However, on the difficult journey out, stopping to work casual jobs to earn the fare to the next town further away from Beni, proper hygiene was a luxury and cramped living and transport was the norm.

Just as they were getting onto the boat to Uganda, her sister fell ill, complaining of pain in her eyes. They nonetheless got onto a crowded vessel only after being prayed for by a pastor. The sister died shortly on arrival in Uganda.

Wizine says she doesn't know what her sister died of. She does not remember being asked by officials at the refugee reception centre if they came into contact with sick people. She did wash her hands with treated water and was given additional Ebola-prevention information in the subsequent days.

'Overburdened' health system

UNHCR's Khan says Ebola screening with infrared thermometers happens at all reception centres and the organisation is working with the government of Uganda to set up more screening facilities.

She also cautions against scapegoating refugees over Ebola since they form only a small minority of movement between Uganda and DRC, along the country's ""long, porous border"".

""Ebola threat is real and of concern but there is no need to panic and we fully believe in the capacity of the government and their efforts to contain the outbreak in Uganda.""

Yet she admits the country's overburdened refugee response is constrained.

""Funding is a big issue. We would like to have more isolation sites for example,"" Khan says.

However, their budgets don't give them the flexibility of planning beyond immediate humanitarian response.

For 2019, UNHCR estimated the refugee response across Uganda would require $927m. So far it has received $150m. Less than 20 percent of what is needed.",no result found,no result found,no result found

Bunia cases draw health minister visit

The resurgence of cases in Bunia—the second-largest city in the eastern DRC—follows the detection of an imported case. Over the weekend, DRC health minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, visited the city to meet with provincial officials to assess the status of the response in the area, according the DRC health ministry's update yesterday.

Last week, the health ministry reported a case in Bunia, involving a contact of an earlier case in Rwampara health zone who had refused follow-up and vaccination. In March, the city reported an infection in a 6-month-old baby. The recent cases bring the total in the city to four.

The city has been preparing for the arrival of more cases for several months and put mechanisms in place quickly, the health ministry said. Kalenga said, ""Putting public health measures in place is one thing, but it is mainly the community that has to take ownership, accept protective measures, and also vaccination, a way to break the chain of transmission.""

Bunia has only one Ebola transit center, where people with suspected Ebola infections stay to await their test results. Efforts are under way to turn Bunia's transit center into an Ebola treatment center, and health officials are drawing up plans to strengthen Ituri province's health system.

More health workers infected

The 35 new cases are from nine different areas, including Beni (9), Lubero (8), Mabalako (7), and Mandima (5), and Bunia (2). The following locations each reported 1 new case: Mangurujipa, Rwampara, Kalunguta, and Katwa.

The latest infections lift the outbreak total to 2,239 cases, and today's World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard suggests that the ministry will report 8 more cases today, which would boost the overall number to 2,247.

In its daily update yesterday, the health ministry reported 3 more Ebola infections in health workers, all from Lubero. Two had been vaccinated, but the report didn't say how long ago. The illnesses bring the number of healthcare workers infected in the outbreak to 122, of which 39 were fatal.

As of yesterday, health officials were still investigating 276 suspected cases.

Regarding deaths, 27 more people in the DRC died from Ebola, lifting the fatality count past 1,500 to 1,506. Of the latest deaths, 12 occurred in the community—which raises the risk of transmission—and 15 occurred in Ebola treatment centers.

Today, the DRC will likely confirm another 18 new cases, which will raise the outbreak total to 2,265. As of yesterday, there were 1,510 deaths, and 269 suspected cases are still being investigated.

Some spots heating up

""New [Ebola] cases continue to occur in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, with fluctuating transmission intensity,"" the WHO's African regional official said in a bulletin released yesterday. ""While the disease trend has reduced in previous hotspots such as Butembo and Katwa, the reverse is happening in areas that previously had low transmission rates, such as Mabalako, Lubero and Mandima.""

In the update, the WHO said cases during the previous 3 weeks originated from Mabalako (36%; 88/245), Mandima (14%; 34), Beni (13%; 33), Katwa (7%; 18), Butembo (6%; 12) and Kalunguta (6%; 15).

The WHO said contact surveillance has strengthened in Butembo and Katwa, with contact tracking ongoing in 22 health zones. A case contact from Katwa who moved to Dubai is being monitored remotely, and continued collaboration between the DRC and neighboring countries has resulted in more than 68 million screenings at border crossings and points of entry to date.

In addition to surveillance, vaccination with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV continues throughout the outbreak region, with 141,754 people vaccinated as of yesterday. According to the DRC's ministry of health, 39,207 of vaccine recipients are high-risk contacts, 72,031 are contacts of contacts, and 30,516 are first-line providers.

New attacks on health workers

A vaccination team and a psychosocial support team are the latest victims of violent attacks in Beni, DRC health officials said yesterday.

The attacks came after the death of a young man who died yesterday in an Ebola treatment center. The man also had a twin brother who is a confirmed case-patient being treated for Ebola.

""It should be noted that these two health areas have reported several cases of Ebola in recent weeks,"" DRC ministry of health officials said. The attacks resulted in no deaths, but the assailants wounded two police officers and burned a car.

Today CARE, a humanitarian organization fighting global poverty, took note of the 1,500 fatalities benchmark by announcing a ramping up of their efforts in the region. The group will expand hand washing stations in schools and distribute hygiene and personal protection equipment, with an emphasis on girls and women, who are the most common household caretakers for patients, according to a CARE news release.

""We must absolutely ensure that local communities are front and center in the response and empowered with the right tools and information to combat the virus,"" said Benoit Munsch, CARE's country director in the DRC.
